lol that's 3 for 150000,61,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1

I was going to guess 120000,536,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
200000,1394,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
I said 150000,1250,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
NO CLUE JUST A GUESS,1394,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
There really isn't any indication other than that they exceeded their goral.,1142,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
*goal,1142,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
something like this seems pretty popular,1641,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
"So hard to just come up with a number, loll",514,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
125000 seems more apt,1426,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
I made a very low guess because I read the question wrong.  I don't have a clue as to how much they could have raised.,240,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
so they probably exceeded by quite a bit,1641,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
"It could have been by 5 pounds or 500,000 pounds.",1142,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
I think they want to know if we'll answer differently after we discuss it.,1668,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
200000,793,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
NOT A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH JUST A GUESS,1394,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
it really diesn't give enough information to make a true educated guess,225,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
Or if we'll stick to our own estimation,1668,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1

Hi,378,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
There are headphones already out there in the world,1250,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
Well so far I am influnced to go up in my guess as I guessed lower than all you at 120000,536,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
im leaving mine as is,1394,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
I sont think it will be a crazy amount that they exceeded,206,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
They also might want to see what numbers people gravitate to in general,514,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
Are they asking for the total for the entire campaign or just the additional amount?,358,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
They exceeded their goals so I am definitely going to raise what I originally put.,240,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
The total,1142,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
it sounds like those things they use for silent discos,1641,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
I'm gonna stick to 150000 I think.,61,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
I think I estimated too high. I think it’s probably close to 150000,1860,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1
This is so strange I wonder if they will give a bonus to the one that guess the closest to right,225,22u5YpwA485h5dMwh1

I guessed 20 since im thinking globally. It didnt say ut was just the US.,582,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
i put 2.5  way too low,1346,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
I put 55M...seems like a reasonable percentage of 690 million total.,614,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
maybe i agree with 55,157,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
with the round trip counting as 2 it could be very high,389,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
40 million is a lot of people just boarding from Newark,107,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
i imagine it is one of the bigger hubs,1031,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
"So everyone is just guessing then, no one with real numbers?",1643,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
instead of 34,157,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
345 million,566,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
175 million,963,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
"I guessed far less... You're talking worldwide. It's a major hub, but so is London, Paris, Tokyo, Dubai, etc. It's not gonna be 20%+ of all air traffic in the world.",1055,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
no way to know real answers its all a guess,692,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
no real,157,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
true though. not sure if the 690 million number is a worldwide number or a US number.,614,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
back to 24,157,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
estimate,1346,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
that is true,1182,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
250,1346,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
"I guessed 18 initially, which is probably low.",1055,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
"Yeah that wasn't specified was it, whole world or USA?",1643,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
hmmmm,157,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
"It would have to be worldwide, right? If it was just the US, thats more tham the country's entire population",582,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
690 mill is def the US number,389,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
us locations,692,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
"^yeah,",1928,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
I think so,1346,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
It around 30-40 million,107,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
34,157,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
It only for one year,107,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
I think it is higher,963,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
yeah that;s a good,1346,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
120 mil?,692,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
lol,692,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
!20 million,963,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
54,157,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
yeah maybe 30-40,1182,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
250,1346,2PQkSkH77w73F9h2y1
I don't know anything about Yemen.,27,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
Hi. I thought there would be about 950.,1329,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I guessed 1000.,185,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I really wasn't sure how to estimate.,750,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
Hello everyone,1775,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
Does anyone think it would be higher or lower than 841?,568,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I said 750,750,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I said 345,510,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I guessed as well,143,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
"I went high with 1500, but really don't know",625,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
"I have nothing about Yemen, i have no clue what to estimate",611,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
i went with 1000 also,1775,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
"no clue, i just guessed 700",403,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I said 500,27,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
Yes i don't know anything,920,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
There's a really bad conflict in Yemen that targets civilians,1329,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I went 800,920,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
"I guessed 343, but no clue",1948,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
"Now, I think it's more like 1000",1302,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
"Said 700, random guess",1145,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
"I had no idea, just guessed",450,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
"I said 678 ,  I had no idea.",590,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
yemen is really a bad place,1302,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I follow a yemen guy and Ive heard him talk about the hell they are in over there,202,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
maybe 1200,1302,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I said 1000,202,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
850,1825,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I think the conflict in Yemen is worse than Somalia and more active. But similar that they both target civilians.,1329,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
yemen is worse than somalia i believe,1775,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I'm glad I learned about Yemen though. I'll read more about it after this is over. Thanks.,750,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
"Does Yemen have a larger or smaller population than Somolia, does anyone know?",568,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
"I was thinking too much about it and didn't get to put in a number, but I think maybe 1000?",611,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I think I may go with 1200,1302,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
Me too.,1948,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I think I'll up mine to 1000,27,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I went with 1000,185,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I think 1000 is probably a good guess - more than Somalia.,1329,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
"It may be more than 850, may be 1000",1825,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
1000 sounds like a good idea,510,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
1000 yea,1145,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
agreed,920,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
Why would we expect there to be more in Yemen compared to Somolia?,568,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
Sounds good,611,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
agreed,1825,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
"Yes, 1000",625,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
Yes 1000,185,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I will do 1000 too,750,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
1000,1775,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
Probably even over 1000.. this has been going on for awhile,202,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
I think maybe 200,568,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
900+,1091,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
not 200,1825,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
Is there a war going on in Somalia?,920,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
yes there is a war in Somalia,1825,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
there usually are civil wars in somalia but not sure if currently,1775,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1
When did the conflict in Yemen start?  Was it active in 2018?,568,3NfZZkuKyMeWuSn7q1

900,694,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
1067,201,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
i said 1800,971,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
baltimore was bad,1821,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
"I guessed 1,500",1609,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
8-900,247,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
I thought Philly might be more than Balt both bad,533,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
"Slightly more, 1300?",1493,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
i haven't heard as much crap about philly,1821,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
yes 8-900,1274,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
PHilly a little under Baltimore,201,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
i think balt is worse,247,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
I was thinking philly would be twice as bad,370,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
"Baltimore is more dangerous than Philly, but Philly is larger",1920,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
"Last time I guessed 1200 as far as I can remember, and got a good bonus. Trying a bit lower to get some more $ now...",212,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
why do you think balt is worse,533,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
Baltimore is much worse,480,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
They are both geto,1595,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
I think baltimore would have more gun violtence. More like brothers there...,1380,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
"okay, so let's go closer to 1000",247,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
which city is bigger,533,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
yes,1274,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
I'm thinking high 900's,1821,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
okay,1061,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
I think balt is bigger,533,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
philly is bigger,1920,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
baltimore worse per person Philly much much bigger city,698,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
"Philly is bigger, Baltimore more thug",201,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
Always top of list I also saw a doc about Baltimore,480,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
thanks jmr,533,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
"It could be higher, but near enough to 1200 to get some good $.",212,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
I hope I get invited again!,212,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
"If philly is larger, there is def more in philly",370,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
1150,1920,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
858,1274,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
you sound very sure,247,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
"that would be my thought if philly is bigger, more incidents",533,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
thats a specific number,247,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
I said 2500,370,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
im stickin with it,1274,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
it's a crap shoot,533,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
1300,1920,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
no pun intended,533,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
philly bigger? 1200+ could be right,247,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
I know Baltimore is worse but idk how mucn,480,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
crap shoot--lol,1274,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
2500 might be a bit far out. Good bonus from a guess of 1200!,212,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
"Yes, size matters :)",201,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
I'll keep my 999.  It's got to be lower by just a little bit.  It's the city of brotherly love... unlike baltimore!,1380,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
Hmm...OK  so you've got this question before?,533,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
Do we change our guesses now?,370,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
NA,1604,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f1
"Hello, my guess is 1500",164,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
Hello,465,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
Thinking it's less than Blatimore?,546,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I said 1000,408,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I think that Philadelphia has a greater population,691,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I think around 775,1639,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
Baltimore,546,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
1500 guess too.,1985,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
1000 too,320,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I put 1000,546,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I guessed about 2400,819,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I did less than baltimore as well,1412,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I guessed higher,691,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
i said 850,1137,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
"hi, m guess was 2000",1103,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I guessed 804,465,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I put 1000 too,1527,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I think it might be more because of population,363,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I'm going with h more,1645,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I was going for 950,581,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I put 755 i think lol,1412,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
"I think its less for sure, but not sure how much",463,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
It should be more,819,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
anyone know the populations for each city?,1527,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
2500,1645,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
Philly is a bigger city,164,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
20,363,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
"Baltimore Population is 619K, Philly is 1.5 Milllion",1137,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
2000,363,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I say 1500,164,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
Population matters little,1639,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I think around 650.,1630,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
but thinking more crime in baltimore?,546,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
"So, probably double?",1985,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
population doesn't matter that much,463,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I thought Baltimore might be more dangerous. Bias??,320,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
1200,1919,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
2500 sounds about right,819,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
i'll go with 2500,363,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
"could be, but I think baltimore is an outlier considering national average",691,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
2500... OK,164,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
sounds high though,581,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
Im definitely way off,1412,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
"but with a greater population, I would guess Philly having more",691,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I'm going for 100 then,581,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
1000*,581,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
"ah, oh well. It's an estimation challenge afterall",691,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
OK 1000 sounds good,164,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
They just throw out whatever number sounds right,1639,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
ok 1000,363,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
200,463,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
yup,581,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
900,465,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
it may be close between 2400 and 2600,1103,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
1000,164,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
google says baltimore is 2017,1137,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
900,546,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
What's the majority feel is good answer?,1645,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
1000,164,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
Depends also on how you measure gun violence. Are suicides included?,691,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
1000,408,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
no,463,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
1000,581,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
Trust facts,819,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
Philly has high crime right?,1412,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
suicides involve 1 person,463,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
1000,164,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
"estimate 5.1 murder per 100,000 in 2018",1103,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
Greater population would include more of those too,691,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
2300,819,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
Says Baltimore is KNOWN for high crime,1137,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
right,691,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
the survey is saying 1000 for baltimore but google says 2000 so who is right,363,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
NA,1076,4rBqFnfAQoCJYr93f2
I chose 4K,1569,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
Hello,896,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
I went with 5.5,1778,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
"I chose 2,300",1310,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
Hi,10,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
"Hi, I put 6K",777,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
It was just a very rough estimate,1569,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
I went lower with 2000,342,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
I said 3K but I really wasn't sure,896,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
1200 here,10,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
I chose 1500,1286,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
I put 2k,673,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
I chose 8k,1403,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
"Hi, I said about 3K",1152,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
"I went with the 10k figure, I probably over shot it a bit...",56,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3500,892,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
was running out of time,673,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
I think that’s way too high,1749,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
I went 3000,1365,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
oh wow i went wayyy lower,1720,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
Hey there I chose 5k,197,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
Fee for 4000,1365,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
Not 10k because u need to make profit,1403,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
"i gave 6, but think too high",627,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
not exactly my area of expertise,56,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3-4 sounds right,627,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
same,1720,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
"By instructions do they mean the cost of tuition, want clarified, but I thought thats what they meant",1569,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
I can go with 3-4k,673,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3500 right,1365,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3500,896,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
7500,892,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
instruction is class only,627,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3500,10,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
Oh ok,1569,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
so no auxillary,627,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3600,892,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3400,1365,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
They need to pay for professors,1403,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3500,896,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
And facilities,1403,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3500 is good with me,673,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
I assumed that 50% of all costs are in advertising and 30% are in working capital,342,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3600 is normal for tuition fee,1365,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
"It's hard because you don't know what is included.  is it just teachers salaries to instruct or does it include buildings, etc",777,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
2500,892,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
it can't be near 10k for instruction only,673,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
"3600 is for one semester, you mean?",56,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
agreed,10,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
Yeah that seems super  high,1569,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
1200,892,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
Is paying the professors counted as student,197,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
I'd say teachers salary only,673,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
I am going with 3500,896,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
but all salaries for a year,673,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3500 yeah sounds reasonable,1569,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3500 is enough,1365,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
probably less than 1/2 is teacher salary,777,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
I'm going 3500 here,10,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3500 is good with me,673,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
me too jdc lol,673,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
Pretty sure its how much they spend on each student to teach them so.... facilities and professors,1403,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3500 it is then,1569,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
May be by experience the fee would be increased,1365,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
i;m thinking just profs,673,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
"yes, my vote for 3500",673,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
I am leaning towards one third of all costs go toward instruction,342,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
850,892,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
It does vary grealy from state to state though and the level of education you are training for,1569,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
Absolute 3500,1365,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
3500 it is,1720,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
seem real,342,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
yes,1365,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1
Gotta believe its a lot higher than 3-4k nowadays,56,4WSepDZvwEFsS5vYQ1

4000,63,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
Hello,50,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
thast my guess,2,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
5000,1589,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
I said 4000.,542,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
4000,1049,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
4000,466,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
I estimates 5000,521,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
I said 6500 as well,1132,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
hello 5000 dollars,1667,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
I put it too low then ha,50,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
3500,804,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
5000,276,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
My guess was 3000,307,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
"I put 3000, because I thought it should be higher, but I'm usually wrong.",1260,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
My guess was 2500 but it is probably higher,162,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
at least half to outsid eexpenses,1667,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
Jojo it should be higher,63,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
i sure hope a majority is for instruction,2,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
I was at 7500 but probably high,1470,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
That’s my estimation,226,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
5500?,2,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
I am pretty confident in my guess.,542,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
tuition usually has fees included and lots of other stuff but a majority is usually the education part,1132,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
5000 is my guess,1667,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
5001,2,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
Professors make a lot of money so it should probably be higher,162,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
5002,2,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
They don't make that much money,1049,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
So say 5500,521,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
6000,2,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
I put 2500.  Probably too low.,226,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
They also have a lot of students per class,276,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
"It kind of depends on what they mean by instruction -- if they just mean faculty salary, it would be lower, but if they include classroom expenses (online learning programs, etc.) it would be much higher.",1260,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
I still think 6000,127,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
can't possibly be more than half,63,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
"yes it does not say room and board, just tuition",1132,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
Most places mark up profit double of cost. And teaching isnt the only expense.,542,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
it really all depends on what they are putting into their figures,162,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
I really think 4000 is close,542,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
5000,2,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1
3500 or 4000 approximate i think,804,4zcNNMsMsfu2JPYyP1

picasso always sells high,1368,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
"not sure, its not really famous",964,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
I know one of Picasso’s has a record of 100 million,650,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
OMG i had no idea I put 50 million lol,1374,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
His pas paintings have sold for like 115 mill. So I think maybe it will be closer to that amount,1415,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
i put in 75,1368,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
"I put 4 million, but I really have no idea. Higher seems more like it.",1163,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1

I put 1.7,952,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
damnn,964,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
anyone read about this or remember?,1374,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
everybody said so high,964,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
"I said 5 million, extremely rare painting, maybe more",152,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
I think 115 million,1087,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
His most expensive painting went for over 100 mill,1277,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
"yes, $50-100M range, right?",1063,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
"maybe closer to 11, not a round number?",2004,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
i think 5-10,964,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
I think 20m,650,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
Average cost is 10 mill,1277,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
I say go high but 50 million? 19 million,152,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
so we have to agree on a final answer?,1374,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
"I read about his painting selling for 115 rather recently, but not sure what it looks like.",1415,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
let see :P,964,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
What about 23 mil?,2004,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
"na, we just have to chat",964,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
Very hig but I know nothing about art prices,1708,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
The $50-100M range wouldn't surprise me. I think my $4 Million early guess was definitely way low.,1163,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
43m,992,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
Im thinking at least $50. Who agrees?,1063,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
Nvm I was wrong about that second number,1277,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
it doesn't seem to be on the list of the 20 top paintings sold in 2018,1368,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
it is called la lampe and sold for 29.6 million,1651,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
over 50 at least,441,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
55m maybe,992,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1
you sure nat?,964,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ1

It could be between 30 and 50,211,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2

where did you find that?,1882,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
29.6 million to be exact,807,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
do you know that for sure jones?,668,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
I'm thinking 1.5 milliong,1006,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
i mean i looked it up,769,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
I have no idea,175,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
25 million?,674,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
"i said 3.5 million, but yeah i was just guessing",493,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
it's 29.6 million,807,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
Is 29.6 exact?,1006,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
i don't think we are supposed to look it up,668,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
I said 45 but knew it was over,1307,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
yeah . Must be 29,211,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
29.562,1318,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
"I thought we were supposed to guess, not look up the answer",1705,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
I guess 5llion,1613,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
it didn't say we couldnt,769,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
i was just thinking about $3 million,1246,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
i remember when this sold,807,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
True it didn't say we couldn't.,1006,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
"Yep 29,562",1016,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
wow that's alot,1613,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
"Well it does say ""give your best guess""",1705,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
probably supposed to guess but haha,332,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
no idea 25,1482,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
29 million is incredible.,1006,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
"I guess it never said that, but it seems implied that we aren't supposed to.",668,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
it's implied that we shouldn't,175,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
It's a Picasso,1318,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
He more art work out there than anyone else,211,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
These things sells for absurdly high prices,1318,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
I'm not aware of original painting prices but that does seem high,1006,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
It's too much for a Picasso lol,1705,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
I wish I had that painting lol,1613,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
I was wondering if we could do a reverse image search! thanks for looking,1882,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
yeah i mean i suppose looking it up isnt against the rules,493,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
"my first guess as 25, pretty close if it's  29.6",674,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
so 29 for sure,175,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
yep,1016,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
"It does say ""give your best guess""",668,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
The painting is unusual but still not sure worth 29 million.,1006,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
Picasso or not,1006,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
Right,1705,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
I was way off at 5 million,1613,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
I agree,1705,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
32 million dollars,38,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
1.5 is fair,1006,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
Money laundering is a powerful thing,1318,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
you should google most expensive paintings to see the real terrible stuff,769,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
haha,175,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
"artists sell, not the art",674,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
Didn't he cut his ear off,1016,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
"250,000",531,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
I am curious what the most was paid for a painting.,1006,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
"No, it has Van Gogh",1318,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2
Lol,1613,6D4oEx4a8r8HoawbJ2

I put 7 Million but I think I way over estimated,1993,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
no idea for sure,279,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1

I'm trying to remember if this is the piece that set a record for the price that it sold.,1313,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
i said 3,703,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
im throwing like 20 million because of the name,1099,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
maybe not too much more than 200?,282,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I guessed 80 million.,1313,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I have never seen this piece before,1810,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
Damn... 200 Million for charcoal?,1993,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
it has to be a lot,1635,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
3 million,1939,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
yeah,703,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
68 is the highest ever van gogh i believe,984,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I don’t know,1733,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
Charcoal is that high.,517,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
3-4 is my guess,205,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
so probably around 8?,984,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
wow really?,1810,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
Thats crazy,1810,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
It’s worth a lot,1733,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
yeah 3 is more,703,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
34?,1635,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
he is dead so no more,279,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
3.6,562,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I think 4 million is enough for that,425,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I'm sticking with 7,1993,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
Maybe 5?,1810,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
4 maybe,703,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I think auction is usually high,279,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I don't even really like it,1635,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I said 1.5,517,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
:0,984,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
i thought 5.5,1275,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
"you're right, it's just charcoal",282,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
oh,703,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
Everything of his is really high,578,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
because there is no more,279,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
Going with 5,1733,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
do we get to reguess?,1636,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
may be not so worth,703,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I doubt it is lower then 2.5,984,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
haha you are looking it up,279,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
3.6,562,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
?,279,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1

I like 5-9,984,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I'll go with 10,1810,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
No more than 5,425,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
but this is a drawing,1275,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I'm thinking more like 20 now,1014,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
4.5-5 ?,539,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
no more than 8,703,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
"Yes, you get to reguess",1993,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I guess 23 but I think I'm going to go lower,1636,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
how about 10,279,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I'l get 24 then,282,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I'm locking in 32. anyone with me?,1635,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
i dont think so,703,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
i am going with 5.5 i think,539,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
15,279,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1

10 is too much,425,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I'm going to lower mine to 5,578,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I think it’s lower - the paintings are the big money,517,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I think i am going for 6.5,984,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1
I'll go with 8,1810,6uaK4yRR7pkoBmFzW1

hey,1908,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
Hello,1861,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
Hi,1727,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I said 250 million,396,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
"I guessed 15, but that feels a little low tbh",1686,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
i guessed 11,1791,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
i guessed 100 haha,609,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I guessed 7 million but I think that's way too low. Maybe 70 million.,1170,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
Hi. So I said 50,461,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
1,1038,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
i said 100 i think but seems too high,1908,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I said 85 but might be more,1742,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I guessed 100 too,1021,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I said 580,1223,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I think 100,1744,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
hi my guess would be 100,1247,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
"I estimated 7 million so, just under 10 percent",182,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I'd say no more than 50,1686,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
How many airports are there in the world?,1727,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I said 345 million. I divided by 2 since trying to think of a quick answer. Not sure that's right tho! lol,1133,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
There are quite a few airports. I probably overestimated.,461,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
are they included layovers?,609,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I would say 50ish,1861,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I thought other airports internationally could be busier,1791,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I think I overshot my answer.,1223,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
i under shot,1038,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I think I'l,1170,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
i agree with thinking international airports would be bigger,1908,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
25-30 maybe?,1686,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
how many airports are there in the US or how many in each state?,1133,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I think that it fepends on the airports,1247,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
but there are 3 airports not just one,1908,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I think I'll guess about 10 % of the total - 69 million,1170,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
nice,1686,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
I think la guardian is big,1223,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
Don't most overseas flights leave from NY?,1861,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
KFK is huge,1247,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1

1200 international airports in the world.,1727,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1
Much less. There are thousands of int airports,461,7covQnu6a7TwpxumY1

Hi there. I just took a guess. I put 30,671,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
I may have been on the high side,295,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
It a Picasso so it will be a huge number,1324,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
30 million seems high,1240,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
crazy people lol,1638,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
Haha 26,145,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1

it's pretty big too,544,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
It looks like a later work,295,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
Haha how high?,68,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
I thought it would be high too,671,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
usually i think art paintings go for 3 or 4 million,1240,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
its def a good size painting,502,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
one sold in 2015 for 180 mil,1258,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
Pretty much rich people have more dollars than sense haha,1324,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
ahaha,1638,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
180 million,1240,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
I will go with 65 million,1324,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
omg,1638,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
i think this may be more like a 20 or 30 million thing,935,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
so pretty high in the mils,1048,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
piasso that famous,1240,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1

hiigher,1240,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
im going to guess 35 million,935,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
I think I’ll stick with 30 as well,671,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
very big piccaso,1638,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
Mid 50s,145,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
10+ million seems just crazy ridiculous ...,502,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
but so does 1 million on a paining (to me lol),502,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
I’ll go with 35,68,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
between 40 and 60 is my guess,1324,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
i mean maybe Bezos bought it lol,935,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1
5 million my guess,1240,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa1

I am thinking that I was  low   at 40,1029,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
Hello. I guess 5 million.,1510,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
3m for me,116,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
Looks like a lot are between 2-5 million,1535,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
i went for 85 million,1322,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
I also guessed 3,737,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
I guessed 110 million,1839,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
30 for me,83,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
No way 85 million lol,1612,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
never seen it before,1320,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
I said one but I think it's closer to 2 or 3,231,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
its a very famous painting. i thi k kts closer to 10 mol than to 1,165,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
most of picasso's paintings are being sold for 60-115 million,1916,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
Yea between 2-5,374,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
Wow we are all over the place,737,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
"Trust me , it is over 30 easy",1029,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
No idea I thought maybe 3,1110,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
anyone know how much an actual picasso sold for in the last 5 years?,1925,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
"Wow, huge spread",310,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
lol,374,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
Hmm,1612,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
I have no idea.,264,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
How much,1320,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
I think its a lot,264,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
i remeber there was a painting sold for 110 million last month but don't know who,1322,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
agree with most of them selling well over 60 - 115,1839,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
crazy yo,374,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
probably around 50 million,1535,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
Well I don't know much about art markets,1612,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
oh wow more than I thought,1110,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
"I was going to say 2 million, but then I realized how big it is. Over 5 feet tall.",1510,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
Wow,1320,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
50-90 would be a good guess,1029,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
60 million?,1535,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
50 million,597,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
yeah im going even higher 110m,165,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
Lets say 80,1029,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
The most expensive one he sold was 100 million,1535,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
but why so much for a painting lmao,374,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
I'll go higher with my next guess,264,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
50 million,310,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
its art,264,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
Thats crazy for a painting,1320,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
because it's probably priceless,1612,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
original,1612,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
80 is a good guess,1029,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
I'm going to say 80 as well,1535,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
but I have never seen this paiting before,1322,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
2.5 I'm sticking with it,1320,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
Df: is that a fact?,165,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
I will go to 10 I think,737,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
the 100 mil as the highest he sold for?,165,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
than not,1839,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
80 sounds good to me,310,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
but its an ugly pic lol,374,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
or 115 I think,1839,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
115 is the highest one of his has sold for,1916,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
"yeah, 100 mil for me",165,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2
Picasso's go for anywhere from 20 to 150,1029,7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2

Hey,1973,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
Hi,1242,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I said 2500,114,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I guesded 1000,316,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
hi everyone,1146,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1

hi.,762,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I am not sure,1889,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
Hi all! Well I am assuming PHL would be lower.,84,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
1200,89,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
2000 here,99,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I said 956,112,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I guessed 1400,1889,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
900,1544,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I said 720,84,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I thought it was lower in Philadelphia,1685,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
"I said 2200, basically double",944,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
3489 here,1116,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I think Philly is less violent than Baltimore. I said about 900.,1140,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I think about 1000.,1501,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
Also went with 2500,1973,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
hi cr 938,291,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I also guessed 1000,1242,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
790,1146,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
"baltimore is a little more rough than philly, but not much",762,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
753,1685,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
Baltimore is bad,316,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
No way; the 2000+ guesses are far too high,84,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I also thought it would be lower in Philadelphia,260,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
so what are we going with?,112,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
The median here seems to be around 1500,114,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
1500,99,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
Philly is no where near as dangerous as Baltimore,1544,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
1500 sounds good to me,1973,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
really?,112,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
i still say 900,762,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
"900 is good, but idk",1146,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
"yeah, I say lower",112,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
"It should be lower in Philadelphia, so I guess about 1000.",1501,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
i think 1000,316,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
but isn't philly bigger too?,1116,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I am in agreement with 900,1544,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
definitely not more than baltimore,762,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
K 1200?,114,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I truly do not believe it is more than Baltimore. I have lived in PHL and visited Bmore on multiple occations,84,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
it should be lower in philly ?,944,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
Philly is bigger,1140,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I don't know much about Baltimore so I'm inclined to believe you that it's worse lol,1889,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
But brotherly love,1140,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
lol,1146,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
yeah,112,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
i think less is more realistic.  baltimore was top 3 or 4 in the country for a while,1685,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I think Phili is safer,291,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
do we need to decide on a single number?,112,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I know Philly has bad areas but also has decent areas,1889,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
Bigger doesn't always necessarily mean more dangerous,1544,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
We should try to decide on one number.,114,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I do not think we need to decide,84,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
1000?,114,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
"I mean, PHL is very, very gentrified in many parts",84,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
omg love the wire,1146,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
hah! yep.,762,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
1000,99,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
including parts that were dangerous 10 years ago,84,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
i can with 1000,112,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
so around 1000?,316,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
1000 sounds good to me,1889,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
*go,112,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
gone from meth to 1mil apartments,84,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
700-900,1140,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1

agreed,1685,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
sounds good,1146,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
1000 seems good,1242,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
agreed,1501,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I'm going to go lower as I don't think we need to agree,84,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I am sticking with 900-something for now,1140,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
agree 1000,89,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
i'll go up 100 to 1000 as a final guess,762,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
"Sure, maybe 1,000 is better",1544,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
me too,1146,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1
I'm sticking with 938,291,8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1

Hi,1453,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
Hi,1605,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
Hello,491,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
Its obvious that the whole amount is spent in  tution,586,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I didn’t really know what to guess here,967,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I think it's more,1532,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
hello,1593,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
Hey,2000,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
Me neither,308,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I meanon instruction,586,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I think it costs more than that to offer instruction,1762,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
Hi,1416,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I guessed $7000,586,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
"I put half, colleges are a profit center.",141,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I said 12000,1532,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
2000,1460,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
3000,1593,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
6000,308,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
Hi I guessed a lot lower,549,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I had no idea just a guess,364,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
5500,2000,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I said 12000,967,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
4000,1453,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I think some would be geared towards caPITAL CONSTRUCTION.  Isaid 2500.,1244,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I said 11000,1605,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I said 1k because textbooks are super expensive for no reason,1814,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
My guess would have been 4000,491,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
2000,549,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
19500,1416,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
actual teaching,1593,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
yes actual teaching,491,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I think that is too low the 2000s and 4000s only because most are state bound and have to spend probably a good porition to instruction,586,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
Actual  learning time is what i was figuring.,1244,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
guessed 7000,364,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
Oh. Well now I think 2500,967,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
When I went to Illinois in 1980 tuition was 40% of the full bill,267,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I'm definitely going with more. Just not sure how much more,1532,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
3500 is my guess,549,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
Also some colleges do have to pay taxes no?,1244,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I think its higher than that,1762,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I guessed $4200,267,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
5500 i think,2000,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I am thinking its now $6000 about half... but I still think $7000 is good because im sure they must have to spend at least half the tution in instruction as most are public,586,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I agree,308,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I also think it would be higher than that as well,1605,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
How many hours of actual classroom time was there?,1244,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
"I think I""m going to stick with my 12000",1532,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1
I'm sticking to 2500,1244,98nescvQF5hkCp9ex1

how are you,473,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
hi,1396,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
hi. i guessed 25000,1683,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
"I guessed 30,000...I think it met it's goal",1252,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
"I put 60,000",1725,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
27000,473,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1

i put 30000,1747,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
"I put 22,000",1950,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I guessed 17000,1738,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I pur 19000,1396,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I think it met or exceeded its goal,1252,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
this one is kinda difficult,623,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
sometimes they go over goal,957,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I out 80000,1548,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
most people like music... but do people like it enough to go to a physical location to listen to a song?,1683,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
It is a pretty good idea I guess the amount raised could be high,1484,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I think it sounds dumb but I bet it exceeded its goal,19,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I guessed 500 - why would you go to specific locations when you can just go on the internet?,1988,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
"It could be fun like Pokemon Go, looking for the locations..",1725,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
put*,1950,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
10000,252,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I am guessing half,784,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I guessed 35000,939,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
might be 10500,473,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
"That's true most people like using their phones, instant gratification",1484,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I thought only 10k,1606,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I don’t think this would’ve done well I said 5000,1646,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I don't think they met the goal,1484,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
10500,473,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I don't think it went over goal  cuz its too much work for millenials to walk,1747,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I don't think they met the goal,1396,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
Didn’t think it was a great idea,1606,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
"depending on the artist, they might want to go to the physical location...be among the first to hear a song",1252,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
i think the number is close either above or below 30,957,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
"I think I'm gonna go lower maybe 10,000",1484,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
like why would you walk around and play Pokemon Go?,1252,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
the question is how did investors react. for 30k you only need one record company to take a punt,19,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
Not too many ppl want to go somewhere to hear a new song?,1606,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
then again someone would steal the song and upload it anyway,1725,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I might go lower also!,1950,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
Doubt it got anywhere close to its goal. 500 pounds. Do they tell you at the end?,1988,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
im thinking 15000-20000,957,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
People still go ro movies though,1548,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
i am actually thinking of higher.. because of the pokemon go reference. who would have thought that would be the success it is,1683,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
maybe the equity helped,957,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
i think 10500 and 17000,473,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I don't know if they tell you,1484,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
I still think higher,19,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
i am going to stick with 25000,1683,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1
who has right answer,473,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK1

"I have no clue, I guessed 12k,",752,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2

"I said 31,000",810,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
I said 15000,1947,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
"I guessed 10,000",193,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
ok  I guessed low 15000,1093,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
it seems like it might go over,810,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
i guessed 280k,22,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
i guessed 10k,419,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
20k,1311,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
"I felt like people would donate, just not enough to make goal.",176,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
"I wasn't quite sure, i guessed 42000 thinking it exceeded",1803,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
Half the amount,1838,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
Perhaps you are right,1803,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
It was an interesting idea.,176,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
I guessed 10k,1409,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
what should we agree on,1093,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
I said exceeded too,810,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
maybe get closer than half,1803,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
"More than half, I agree.",176,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
maybe 24K?,1803,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
19000,1093,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
I think half,1838,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
20k,1311,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
maybe 20000?,856,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
24K is good by me,176,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
we seem to be around 20-25,1523,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
24 k is good,1967,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
i say at least 10x the initial goal was raised,22,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
Faith I agree people will donate as they can,1290,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
15k,1838,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
We dont have to agree,810,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
Definitely didn't think it would make it's goal,1947,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
20k,418,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
They asked for 30k and didn't get 30k? That would seem weird to me.,1568,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
maybe 20000,1093,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
I agree 15k,1838,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
I still like 20,1523,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
It's kind of a fanciful idea.,176,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
I think they'll get the 30k for 35% control of the company,1568,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
I like 20k,419,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
To drop things out in public.,176,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
in my experience crowdfundign apps almost alwasy exceed their goal by a large margin,22,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
I'd guess 50k. Think about shark tank,1568,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
Mhmm...like who has time to go to a specific location??,1947,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
if you've guy seen that tv show before,1568,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
I think 20k still,1311,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
Crowdfunding fails all the time,419,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
pokemon go,810,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
I didn't think it would make its goal,856,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
if someone asks for 30k for 35% they think their company is worth 100k,1568,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
Im saying 20000,1093,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
Depends on the musicians that are involved though,856,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
"Yeah, the planning to go to specific locations would be a small pain",176,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
I think close but not 30k,1523,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
"faith thinking like shark tank 50,000 sounds good",1290,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
youre all wrong,22,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
"I don't think it would make its goal either, it's an extremely niche concept that doesn't exactly scream ""modern""",752,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
How the heck is someone only going to get 10k for 35%,1568,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
I think about half considering the project,1838,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
im sticking with 280k,22,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
that's crazy,1568,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
I'm going with 20k,419,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2
mike what do you think',1093,AHJqx322b5o6CTbwK2

what did you all guess?,906,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
hello,1779,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
1200 or so,1164,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
I guessed 3509,371,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
2400,1710,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
2000,1395,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
I was at 3000,906,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
I guessed 2000,1102,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
around 2000,1863,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
I guessed about 1200,1339,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
1500,1334,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
1650,579,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1

1500,1959,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
3000,1822,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
"I figured it would be higher than baltimore, but not much",1164,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
Isn't Chicago a pretty crime heavy city? I guessed 3000,1545,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
11600,42,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
1800,1779,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
Baltimore is also crime heavy though,1164,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
think chiago is more but not that much more,1339,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
They have over a hundred gun events in a weekend.  I think it is more like 6000,559,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
I think Chicago is worse in gun violence than Baltimore,33,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
It’s definitely higher than Baltimore,371,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
I agree its higher,1164,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
Which city is bigger?,1545,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
"yeah, I thought a 50% increase over Baltimore. But just guessing really",579,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
Chicago,1164,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
Chicago,33,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
chicago by far,1779,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
50% over is probably close,1164,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
i've heard that Chicago has a high rate but never really thought about it,863,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
maybe middle ground between 1500 and 3000... say 2000?,906,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
I live somewhat close to Baltimore and hear more about Chicago gun violence,33,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
Its4372,1789,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
"I'm no good at geography, but I think Chicago is bigger and has more violence",1822,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
I think either 3000 or 3500 is close,371,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
Chicago higher for sure just don't think its much higher like is assumed,1339,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
I did not google it,1339,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
Nope lol,371,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
that's really specific number lol,33,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
TRUE,42,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
I didnt either,1164,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
Chicago has been going up in crime steady for a while,1102,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
I figured they want a discussion,1164,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
same here,1339,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
I find it interesting so many think its a lot higher,1339,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
they want us to use our heads,1710,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
can we agree on 3000?,906,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
"It didnt say not to, but I assumed if we could look it up, it defeats the purpose",1164,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
"either way, it should be definitely higher",1779,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
seeing all your guesses i'd go with 3000,863,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
I'm thinking close to 3000 too,33,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1
pretty sure Chicago has the most gun violence in the USA,1395,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk1

"Chicago has the most gun violence in the nation, so I really went up there",1207,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
"Hi, do you think higher or lower than Baltimore?",434,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
Yes and much larger city,1161,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
Hello,1437,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
yes,560,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
"I guessed 7,500 and I still think that may be too low",321,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I would think so.,1168,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
Hello!,1931,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I think chicago is the most violent,1478,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I guessed much higher than baltimore,728,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I think higher,1161,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I assumed there would be a lot more,1891,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
Chicago is more vient,321,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
5000,560,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
violent,321,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
"i said 2,500",149,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
YEs I guessed 5000,1045,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
But by how much?,1168,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
it's definitely higher but hard to say how much,274,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I only guessed 1240,1158,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I feel like it might be baltimore,773,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
Like 4x the population of Baltimore,1161,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I guessed over 5600,728,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I also said 2500,1168,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
quite a bit higher,1931,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
"Hi all. I'm thinking substantially more violence in Chicago. 2,000 is my guess.",1281,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I guessed 1300,773,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
"I put it at 35,000 incidents. There are constant shootings in Chicago",1207,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I guessed over that but I think I might be wrong,1891,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
4x the population so do we think it's more than 4x as much?,274,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
i said 2500 but complete guess,1792,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
Maybe 4000,1161,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
"Chicago entered 2017 reeling from a record year of gun violence: More than 750 people had been killed in more than 3,000 shootings, numbers not seen in more than two decades. Much of the violence was concentrated in Englewood, a neighborhood in the city’s southwest.",1478,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I went for 40k but I guess I was aiming too high,1891,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
that's offensive to libya,1207,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
"so 2017 was ""only"" 3000 shootings?",274,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
Sol that's good info,728,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
maybe I will lower it to about 5000,321,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I put the same number,1437,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I'll try 8200,1158,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
Cool!,1478,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
yes thank you sol,321,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I'm sticking to 5600,728,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I will try 5k,1891,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I dont think thats even possible,773,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I'll do 5500 instead,1158,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I think somewhere in that range is possible,728,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
5000 sounds good,434,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I wish we would get confirmation on this lol,321,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I'm gonna say 3000,773,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I think that the estimates might even be low because it's any gun related incident  of violence,1045,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
Maybe 3500,1478,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
I didn't change my mind - 5000,560,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
since it is for 2018,1478,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
yes thats true it doesnt have to be murder,321,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
NA,180,aitxLzqaSHv5hohsk2
Hello!,479,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1

Hi there!,1197,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
I'm not actually sure what the population of NYC is,1392,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
hello,1261,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
Hello everyone.. I put 60 Million..total guess,438,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
Hello,1215,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
Hey,873,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1

Hi,1827,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
i put 45,1261,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
hi,241,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
I thought about 200 million,1197,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
hi,1807,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
I started at 50,438,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
hi,666,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
I put 30...just a wild guess.,57,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
oh way more then eh,438,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
i put 80,77,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
i guessed 75mil,855,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
i guessed 250 million -- but think that is high now,241,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
I figured it's a major hub,1392,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
Is the total in the us or the world?,1769,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
I put 70,873,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
53 is my best guess,1215,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
40 maybe. not a math guy,3,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
Ohk....,1371,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
500,2016,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
but this is 2009,438,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
"I guessed 20 mil, probably low",1827,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
including the people who live there who woud use that airport,1392,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
I have just mentioned 2,1371,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
i put 60,666,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
i couldnt actually guess,1807,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
ahh tricky question,1197,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
it dint let me guess either?,3,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
have you voted already?,3,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
Lot of flight boards in NYC,873,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
a round trip counts as 2 passengers?,241,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
I know places like denver whch is not a huge city is a mjaor hub. I have gone through an NYC airport for transfers before,1392,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
i thought because people use new york as a connector airport,77,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
70 to 80 is my answer,873,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
no i didnt vote,1807,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
I checked and it shows 6.5 million,1371,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
how many people here are real and not bots?,3,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
60 mil sounds good to me,1827,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
ah,241,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
im real,1197,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
I am real,666,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1

I am real,1827,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
I am also real ..lolz,1371,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
230 i guess,1807,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
i think the way this is set up is that people are real,1392,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
"said 160,000 per day fly right now",438,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
i think 200+ is probably right,1261,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
anyone else unable to put in an answer?,3,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
yes i am a real person,1807,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
Have a good day guys,873,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
well I am gonna stick with 60 total guess,438,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
i put in answer,1197,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
The answer is between 6 and 7 million,1371,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1
thanks,1392,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs1

Hi,501,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Hello,812,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Hello,958,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I put 3 million but I am open to change. just guessing,1656,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
hi,1659,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
anyone got any ideas,361,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I think I may be low,1088,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
HI,700,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
hello,1656,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Hey,341,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Any ideas? Im not sure,812,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I did 23,361,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Anyone fly much?  I haven't flown in over 30 years and never to NY.,155,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
is this for the entire world?,1656,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I put 150 milliion,1659,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Hey,719,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I did 45 but I have no clue.,700,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I think its out of the entire world,812,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
i put 150 too,501,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I randomly guessed 400,1681,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
NYC is a big hub,501,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
loos high at 150,361,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Is this worldwide or just US,6,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I put 350.,958,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
100 I put,588,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I guessed 100 but it might be low,812,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
because there are a lot of airports in the world so 690 for the whole world. I can't imagine 1/4 of the world  is New York,1656,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Ny and no are major hubs...number is high,1222,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Most people fly round trip.,958,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
we are not told if hat is us,361,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I entered 1 million,719,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
"Hmmm I put 350, that's just because I hear about Ny airports frequently",155,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I guessed 10% and put in 69.,1914,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
lena - looks too low,361,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I put 2 million,26,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
100 minion would mean 1 in 6 people in the entire world flies in New York. too high,1656,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Oops.  I am very high.,958,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
agreed,361,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Hi. I put 6 million. Is this for world traffic? I suspect the share of US traffic would be higher.,570,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
maybe something over 100 million,1659,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
i am comfortable with 23,361,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
"yeah, it's not clear,  US vs World.  Oh well.",1914,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I'm sorry but 1 in 6 people cannot fly in New York. it's not even the busiest airport in the US let alone in the world,1656,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I think 100,1088,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
"In 2016, 59 million passengers flew from JFK.",341,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Use that for your answers and think critically.,341,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
I think it's less than 100,700,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Cant be but so many to board a plan in 1 location at a time,719,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
"oh you all have great points, thank you",155,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
"No problem, Jinx.",341,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
it must be US only then,1656,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
"In LaGuardia, again 2016, almost 30 million passengers.",341,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
that would make a huge difference,1656,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
So you're all saying too low are incorrect I feel.,341,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Staying with 2 million,26,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
It's going to b ea high number.,341,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
really,361,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
"Well you just googled it, then we have the answer.",501,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
"For 2016, yes. To give you all an idea.",341,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
It’s a high number,1222,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
good luck everyone,1656,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
It's going to be a high number.,341,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2
Just saying. Lol.,341,BhmmzKb4ubQnyutAs2

Hi,1341,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Hi there,351,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Hello,1760,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I think Yemen has a smaller popualatin than Somalia.,1557,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I know that Somalia is really unstable.,1801,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Hello,503,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
hi,1424,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Hi,955,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Hi! I guessed there were 500 attacks in Yemen,1880,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Hello,1979,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Hi,851,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Hi,110,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Hi,755,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I guessed 455,1557,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
HI,973,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I guessed 600 in Yemen,1760,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I said 750,1109,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I guessed 434,955,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
But Yemen has been increasingly unstable as well.,1801,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
"I think Yemen is a lot less dangerous than Somalia, right?",351,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I guessed 600,1801,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
TRUE,1557,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
1500,1424,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I guessed 358,1979,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Hi.  I said 750,989,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
may  be 1000,1341,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I guessed more than Somalia,503,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
There is a civil war in Yemen,44,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I guessed 300,1224,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I'M NOT SURE,973,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
"I think Yemen is less dangerous, but it's a larger country than Somalia",1760,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Hi,1379,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I guessed it would be higher 1225,110,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I think it is less than Somalia but may be higher than I thought,1557,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
still it is unstable,1341,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
"OK, guess I'm way behind the times.",351,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I thought Yemen would have more,851,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
so lets make it 1000,1341,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I don't know much about what is happening in Yemen or what happened in 2018,1880,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Are we not allowed to look this up,1109,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
900,1379,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Oh okay,1109,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Was cibvil war happening in 2018 as well?,1557,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I don't think we are supposed to look it up,851,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
In yemen?,1557,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
no,1341,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
The civil war is still occuring,44,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
yes in yemen,1341,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I don't think we can look it up,973,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I believe it would have increased,1341,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
"Yes, just wondering is it started in 2018 or 2019 or before either",1557,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I think most conflict in Yemen are not reported,503,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
"If there's a civil war, it's probably pretty high",955,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
"It started years ago, in 2015",44,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
so it might be 1000,1341,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
so less than Somalia but on the high end,1109,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
I think more than somalia,44,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
yea maybe so,1109,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
"It's probably in the same range as Somalia, maybe higher cause it's the middle east.",989,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
the government has been killing civilians under the guise of a civil war,44,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
yes more than somalia,1341,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
Sounds like more than Somalia then,1880,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
my guess is 950,973,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
yemen has maybe twice as many population as somalia,1760,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1
NA,1896,bwipE8QyLKqJaYXpM1

hi,1077,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
HI,633,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
Hi,357,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
So what did you guys guess?,1363,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I don't even know how to go about estimating this--you guys?,1907,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
hi,1229,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
hi!,1951,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I went over,1951,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
28000,1997,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
"I think they raised 20,000",235,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I said 20000,789,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I guessed they raised half,916,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
i guessed 15000,156,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
i guessed 10000,713,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I SAID 10000,633,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
"i said 20,000 too",1907,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
Z500,273,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
22,1154,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
My number was way higher than everyyone else LOl,1951,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
why did so many of us think that?,1907,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
"I said 21,000",1229,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
Doesn't spotify have this functionality?,916,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
Good,273,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
"I said 10,000",1442,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
i wasn't sure. i guessed 60000,1232,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
"I just wrote 100,000, crowdfunding for things like this can go above their initial amount.",1251,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
"yea, it sounds a little iffy to me",156,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
at least on the first try because of the hype,1229,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I went way higher,357,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I interpreted the question differently than a lot I said 100000,1361,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
"50,000",357,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I went lower,1363,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
Yea I guessed 60k,1951,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I think people care about music but they were asking for a lot of money therefore did not reach the goal,789,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
"This type of crowdfunding typically raises 2/3 of the amount so I said 20,000",235,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
Agree,1442,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
i think its a lot less,1154,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
i feel like most crowdsourcing campaigns don't get the full amount,1907,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I think the equity would be attractive to big investors,1951,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
20000 is good,273,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
yea agreed on them asking too much,156,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I dont think they reached the goal,1363,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
jojo what are you basing the 2/3 figure on? is that a fact you know?,1907,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
"I'm sticking with 20,000",235,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
Yeah the equity is an important point,1251,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
"I thought it was high too, but people will try something out so they may have gotten a surge",1229,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I THINK PEOPLE CARE ABOUT MUSIC BUT THEY WILL BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN GET OUT OF THEIR INVESTMENT,633,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
"I am sticking with 10,000",1442,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
i believe i over estimated,1232,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
TRUE,273,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I AM STAYING AT 10000,633,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
It's kind of tough to say on this one,1951,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
does anyone have stats?  figures on other attempts?,156,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
they would get equity in the company in exchange for the money,1363,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
i will drop my guess to around 25000,1232,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
but is it a good investment?,1363,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I think 20000 as well,1997,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
"thanks jojo, that's helpful",1907,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I think 25000 is a good guess,1363,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
It really depends on what they offer and even then they strangest things manage to make a lot of money on crowdfunding,357,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
mmm I still think Gen Y and boomers believe in the music industry,1951,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
"If the target is young people I still say 21,000 total after its spread on facebook and what not",1229,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I would think they would have raised a little more than half thats why I said 20k,789,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I think I hold off on investing my own money,156,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
although it hasn't been that profitable for years,1951,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
I can see this going over,1951,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
maybe not,1232,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
It's a unique idea and could go above the amount for sure,1251,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
"Boomer here, bands started off playing for free!",156,CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1
thoughts?,1447,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
I don't see how they would raise all their money,1698,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
"I'm thinking maybe 200,000?",558,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
it is only headphones,1698,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
How much are you thinking,1402,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
"I said 200,000",1293,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
I meant to say 100000,1486,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
I said 300000,1730,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
200k seems about right,1425,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
yes 200000,1978,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
People love their music.,558,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
I have no idea,505,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
i thpught 75k,1698,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
"I went with 250,000.",524,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
TRUE,1486,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
I say about 200000,797,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
"I’d say 200,000",1695,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
this question is just for the 2nd round seeking 100k lb?,1447,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
Lets go 200000,1402,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
With so many headphone options I don’t see how,30,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
I put 200000,505,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
after rethinking it,797,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
i agree with 200000,786,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
okay,1486,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
I went with 125k since they had already done a previous one maybe they didn't raise much more than the goal.,887,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
i said 130,1447,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
how about 150000?,1104,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
The most crownfunded funds were like millions and they were pppular things like the Criticl role series,1730,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
165000,139,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
I say go with 200000,797,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
And this is just headphones,1730,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
Yeah I think 200k is reasonable. Often when companies exceed goal they exceed by a lot:,524,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
Ok 200000,505,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
"I think 200000 is optimistic, but okay.",1486,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
200k lets all do it,1402,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
Think of beats headphones too,797,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
"I could see it becoming a trending thing if more and more people started donating thats why I'm thinking 200,000.",558,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
High end,797,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
"i guess campaigns either don't hit/barely hit goals, or they way over-raise",1447,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
yeah what james said,1447,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
"ok, 200k. Don't underestimate audiophiles and their gadgets.",887,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
200k sounds good to me,1730,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
"if they needed to raise a second round, doesnt that mean that the company has not been as successful",1698,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
why not 300???,1447,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
where does it say high end?,1104,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
Like Beats!,797,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
That's what I was thinking,1486,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
It doesn't say high end,797,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
why have to fund raise again,1486,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
Just says club and dance music,1730,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
the description implies they are high end,1447,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
I was saying beats are high end and look how much they are,797,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
it replicates the sound of being in a club,1447,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
who even does that anymore,1698,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
"(which ive been to, the sound is too loud to sound good anyuway)",1447,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
just means bass heavy,1104,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
the sound and style like being in a club screams high end to me,797,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
youth will lov,1486,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
"Probably they wanted to get more funding to push more units and rsther than use their own money , looked to crowds",1730,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
"It says first round was successful, and company has made thousands of sales, I think people would be eager to get equity in the company.",524,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
love,1486,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1
the implication is this is something desirable though,1447,dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1

hello,1933,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
Hello,1022,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
hi,268,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
hi,1753,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
Any thoughts?,1004,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
hello,118,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
hi,550,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I think they received more than they sought.  This is very creative,850,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
hi,1608,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
hello,439,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
hi,125,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
How are you?,1922,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
good i idea,1753,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
i doubt it was a successful campaign,910,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
i think so,1608,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
"Hey, I went higher.",1658,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I don't think it will reach its goal,550,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I think they raised the full 10500 pounds (35%),214,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
i'm guessing they only raised about half,1933,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
"I think they raised the 15,000",1008,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I don't think it met it's 30k goal because it would require people to go to physycal locations to listen to music they might not even like,268,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
The physical loactions thing sounds like a dealbreaker,1004,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I am not sure it is a great idea,1008,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I said 25000,550,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
it would be kinda like Pokemon where you have to find songs,850,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I agree.  Especially if they were a good songwriter,1922,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
i said 15k also,268,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
TRUE,1753,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
"I didn't think it was successful either. I said 19,000",118,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I think 10000,1632,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I'm not sure that it was successful.  I'm trying to think if I would actually use the service.,125,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I didn't get the chance to write in my prediction as the screen changed!,1008,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I rhink it also depends how effort they out in the company with all the competition,1022,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
prob 15k a lot of people dont fund stuff like this,951,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
i think 12000,1608,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
"I am sticking with 15,000",1008,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
"I wouldn't use it, so...",1004,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I meant 1000,1632,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
Mine said 30k was sought...i see other numbers,850,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I wouldn't buy it,1008,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I said 6000,125,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
Probably less than what they wanted,1117,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
so maybe less than 15k,1933,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
There's so many streaming sites it's hard to compete,1753,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I said 25090,1022,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I said 50000,1922,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
but this streaming site has a unique twist,850,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I wouldn't purchase it.,118,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
It is hard to compete and it's too common,125,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I said 15000,1004,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
What is the twist?,125,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
i said 20k,1608,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
the idea of the app is good but i'm not sure how much they actually raised,439,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
you have to go find the songs. Kind of like a scavenger party.,850,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
"i said 30,000 but that's cuz i read the question wrong haha",439,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
What is the twist? The dropping at the physical location?,1008,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
If your streaming services offer more than those out their you can make it,1022,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
that's takes a lot of effort,125,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I like convenience,125,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
Yes,1753,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
So it's Pokemon GO for music?,1004,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
"it would be fun for teenagers, which is probably the target audience.",850,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I'm going to stay at 15k,268,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
yeah,118,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
Haha Pokemon GO for music,1008,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
"i'm going with 9k, as my final answer",1933,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
"yes, Pokemon Go for music",850,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I'm staying with 6000,125,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I doubt I'd walk somewhere to hear music when its all on youtube,951,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
20000 for me,550,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
i stay at 20000,1608,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
"i like that, pokemon go for music",1933,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I like being a le to listen any place without internet so down load is a must,1022,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
go for it,62,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
"I may drop my prediction to 10,000",1008,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
19000,118,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
Yea people want to listen from their home,1117,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
I just realized it was pounds,1004,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
"I think that would be fun, but not necessarily popular right away",1632,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1
Hey,1780,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
Hi,66,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
8 pounds,325,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
Hello,1560,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
hello,327,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
Hello,1872,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
I bet it didn't raise much.,327,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
hi,658,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
hey,840,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
Hello,1075,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
Sounds like a great app. I'm sure it would be overfunded,770,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
hello,1739,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
No way they raised their goal,840,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
Hi,655,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
10000,1780,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
I think it would be underfunded,1872,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
It seems weird to me. I don't know why I'd want to drive somewhere to l isten to something.,327,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
I doubt they raised a lot,642,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
Maybe,1780,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
I say 9000 being generous,840,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
"I said 19k, but I have no idea. My big concern is how investors would get their money back",66,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
"I said 8,000",642,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
I think doubled,1560,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
I agree I said 5000 being generous.,327,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
"I said 10,000",1872,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
I saw how Pokemon Go went - I thought it brought in a lot,1075,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
"I agree , I think maybe they raised half but not the full amount?",1739,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
yeah i said 20k but that was way generous,1155,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
why would I go around and try to pick up songs by artists I don't know?,642,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
Why would people want to go to a physical location to listen to music?,840,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
Geocacheing and Pokemon GO were huge,770,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
I thought they would exceed their goal,1345,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
yeah 20k is prob way too generous.,327,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
This is those for music.,770,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
I guessed it shot over the amount they were asking for,1075,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
"I guessed 30,000 because of Pokemon people",621,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
"40,000",655,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
"I appreciate them trying to get people to walk more, but I don't think this is the way to do it",642,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
35000,607,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
"Music is different from a ""collect them all"" game",1872,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
decent amount of equity,1560,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
I guessed 15000,1739,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
I bet its either REALLY successful or flopped REALLY hard,66,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
People seem to love scavenger hunts,1075,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
jd I agree with you,1075,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
"40,000 to 45,000",655,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
probably depends on where it is,658,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
I think if it was launched some pokemon go type of people would use it but I don't know if they'd actually fund it.,327,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
they're offering a lot of equity,1844,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
"Artists promoting music is not really the same as a global billion dollar franchise like Pokemon, unless they got an Ariana Grande level talent on-board",840,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
"I went with 47,000",1075,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
Heres the question for an investor though....how is it going to make money?,66,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
100 k is normal I think,325,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
"Pokemon Go is different, in my opinion, because pokemon has a fan base already",642,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
true it depends on their talent level too,327,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
They're saying pounds. People walk more there anyway.,770,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
The app would need partnerships with A-list pop stars with built in fanbases,840,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
pokemon is completely different and so is the harry potter one,1155,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
and pokemon is a game where you get 'rewards' etc...maybe if there were rewards you could earn,327,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
Yes very different,1739,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
I just don't see it in the age of streaming and MP3s,840,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
"Is 10,000 to low then",1780,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
Good chat!,840,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2
i agree it sounds like too much effort to listen to music,327,EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2

What do you all think?,49,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
What did everyone put,986,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I think there were about the same number of events in both locations.,1669,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I put 1200,986,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I put 400 anyone close to that,166,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I put 900,1669,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
"my guess is less than Somalia but still significant, so 652",1701,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I wasnt sure so i put 500,49,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61

"I think a little less, like 500",858,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I think Yemen is just a bit less.,1702,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I put 425 - total guess,811,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I don't have a good clue I think a bit more i put 1000,1777,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
850,1314,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
It was just a random guess,166,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
Both places have conflict,1669,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I think Yemen would be more,1472,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
"I put 912, which was a complete guess.",1119,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
There’s a civil war in Yemen though so I’d think a lot,986,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
My guess was a little lower than the original.,1083,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
Not hearing much these days so hoping they went down a bit,442,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
i had way less than you all,723,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
Somalia is such a hot bed of conflict.,1702,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
Yemen's conflict is much more active currently,1472,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
"Yemen's gov't is more stable than Somalia, but not by much",858,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
Yes it is,1314,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
Hopefully I am wrong and the number is actually less,1669,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
Yemen does have a very intense conflict,49,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I was thinking Yemen might have more but haven't really heard anything about it,166,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
same,49,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
same,1777,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
Terrorist run that country,858,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
Sounds about right,1314,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I haven't heard anything about Yemen or Somalis lately.,1702,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
same,236,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
Both places still have conflict,1669,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
so what is a good #?,723,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I hope that's still the case next year,858,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
It will be interesting to hear the answer,166,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
550,858,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
500?,49,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
i would think within a couple hundred of the number for somalia,1701,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I wish the number was zero,1669,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I imagine a good guess is anywhere around the Somalia number,986,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
Agreed,1472,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
same =(,1777,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I agree,1669,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
Hard to hear about this,858,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I would guess 500 too,442,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I wish the number was zero too.,1083,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
TRUE,442,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
I'm thinking maybe I should have entered a lot less than I did. I said 700.,1702,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
maybe youre right,49,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
700 is realistic,442,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
700 sounds fine to me,986,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
it is,49,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
agreed,49,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
700 sounds good,1777,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61
500 then?yeahthen?,723,ffGhseFHjGuQNWGR61

Guessed 900,1149,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
my guess was 1023,763,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
Guessed 700,535,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
I guessed 800,1596,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
700,1150,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
i guessed 2000,173,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
Guessed 650,518,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
Hi guessed 542,1746,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
550,1647,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
650,200,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
"I guessed 1500, that's probably high though.",445,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
900,431,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
i guessed 500,498,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
420,1485,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
500 aswell,397,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
I guessed 900 as well,1921,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
i cant see it being higher then somalia,200,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
Went with 550 but not really based on anything,640,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
576,683,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
i guess 750,929,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
So our lowest is round 500 and highest is round 1000,1149,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
so take the average?,763,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
750?,763,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
I tried to guess but my time ran out. I was going to say 1000,14,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
"Perhaps, thats just one solution",1149,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
550,1647,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
750 seems like a great guess,535,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
I was not sure.,14,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
Does anyone know where yemen is,1149,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
i think it's higher than Somalia,173,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
middle east,173,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
arabian pennesula,200,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
"going with the average sounds like a good idea, or maybe a little higher than somalia",445,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
"civilians being bombed by governments and factions, right?",173,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
May be higher than somalia,1647,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
Compared to somalia gotta think if its better or worse crime rate wise prolly,1149,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
no,200,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
basically,445,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
quick google search showed 18 a week in 2015,1746,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
its not fricken syria,200,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
I think it is kind of high though,14,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
"Im thinking its not as bad as Somalia, but just a guess",535,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
18 a week would be 936 a year in 2015,763,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
30 seconds left,1149,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
Hm,1149,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
750 is fine with me,200,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
i think 850,1746,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
so 900?,397,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
I'm not sure,14,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1
750,929,g3nYLKtFsh3FJjoCy1

hello,1456,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
Hey,1463,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
"2,000 to 3,000?",387,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
Hey! I said 4500,618,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
So I don’t think the number is that high,1095,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
Remember that most students are also covering back office costs and premise cost,1002,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
hello,1451,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
Most schools don't spend a lot on each student,288,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
hi,1513,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
i put 2500,1276,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
i said 2300,1456,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
i thought 2k,70,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
I said 2000,1095,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
3500,362,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
I was thinking less than 3000,1273,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
2000 from me,1002,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
1500,288,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
I said 4000,1463,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
5000,1159,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
i'd feel like 1500,767,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
4500 here,1124,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
4300,1451,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
3000,1159,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
I said 5000,930,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
cant be more than 1/3rd i guess,362,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
"Professors get paid way less than most people think, too",1095,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
i went 3500,1513,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
yeah,767,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
Do you think half of the tuition really goes directly to instruction,1273,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
Agreed. Less than a third for sure.,1095,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
I don;t tink it is a high as most of you are thunking,617,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
students cover most costs themselves,70,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
I think instruction is pretty narrowly defined term,1273,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
Not for instruction,1095,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
Does anyone have more reliable information?,1124,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
It is only asking fir instruction cost. Not total cost.,387,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
TAs,1002,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
ok,930,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
Teachers,1002,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
a big chunk goes to construction,1456,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
Yeah,1463,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
how about 3500,930,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
i imagine a lot of the tuition covers administrative costs,767,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
Buildings and overheard are a lot  3500,1159,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
$10k spent is split across each University and the pay is unfair,288,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
things like building new additions to draw in more students,767,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
"I think that is too low, though",930,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
250.00  most,617,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
That feels low,1095,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
i think 3500,1159,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
So maybe around 3500?,1273,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
3500,362,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
yes,1159,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
probably closer to 2000,767,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
3500 then,930,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
public students have more than 100 students in the lower division courses,1456,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
NOt so much,1002,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
I think I’m gonna stay around 2k.,1095,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
Department overhead,1002,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
TAs,1002,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
"yes, 3500 is a good number",1124,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
Thanks for the input everyone!,1095,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
1500 is what most districts spend and it may be less but no less than $1K,288,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
So less than 3500?,1463,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
ok,930,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
3500,930,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
remeber where talking about one student and one instruction,617,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
YES that is v important to remember too,1095,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
"I think it is higher, but we can go with 3500",930,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
i thknk i will drop from 3500 to 2800,1513,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
1500,288,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
Think of the amount times all the students,1095,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
larger class sizes mean less contribution by student,1002,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
3500 it is then,362,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1
good points,1273,g7sk9XMgwRnD9r9fR1

1 million,1062,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I put 1.2 million total guess,1785,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I went high and said 2.7,161,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
Hello,1961,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I put 2.5 lol,137,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I would say around 3 million,778,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I guess 3.5,1808,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
3 million I put on,1687,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
HELLO,653,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
what does everyone think an estimate of the drawing?,349,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
i guessed 1.8,60,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I've never heard of this drawing.,1408,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
i way overestimated and put 6 million lol,1064,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
hello,1543,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I said about 4 millio n,349,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
Never even seen it,1687,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
wow I guessed really low then!,1785,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I kind of said round the average as all of you. 2.5 million.,1393,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I guessed 1.5,1981,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
does anyone know when Van Gogh died?,137,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
Oh I was way higher than all of your guesses lol,1706,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I would guess anything between 1 and 2 million,507,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I think it will be fairly high because  of who drew it.,778,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
Are we supposed to then come to an consensus on what the sale price was?,1393,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
1.2 i estimated,1543,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I would think it would be high because of the age and who drew it,349,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I guess I'll go higher on my 2nd guess then,1785,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I still think 3,778,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
2.5 milliion not his best,1961,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
No idea but I just chalk it up to 3 could be less,1687,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
It's small and not a painting,1062,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
he died in 1890 if that means anything,137,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
does anyone know what a painting of his would go for?,60,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I think 3 is goo. Anything higher that 4 is overstating it,507,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
3 sounds good to me too,653,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
"I'm sure it went in the millions, just not sure how high?",1393,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
3 seems to be a middle estimate,349,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
3 sounds good,1981,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
3 sounds good,1808,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
It being chalk has a lot to do with it.,778,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
3,1393,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
3 sounds good here too,137,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
3,778,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
it's charcoal,137,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
sure 3,60,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
"I guess I'll say 3 million as well, and yeah is it a painting?",1785,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
3 million is good,1961,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
drawing,137,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
I think 2.5 to 3 sounds about right too.,1408,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
NA,170,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
NA,108,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt1
i said 3.5. i have no idea though,1375,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I guessed 7 mil,443,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
"i really had no idea, i guessed 12 M",75,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
hello,2040,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I guesed $3million,954,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
it may be small but feel big,1312,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I said 2 mil. too low?,1033,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I went with 2.5,735,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I said 18 million,545,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
i guess 40 million,927,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I said 3,1046,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I almost said 7 then switched to 3,88,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
van gogh sells for high,927,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I said 1 million,1398,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
"I only guessed 2, but I have no idea how much it's worth.",1994,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
van gogh is a pretty big artist,75,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I know he is quite famous and his paintings command a premium.,1360,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I'm way low at 1 mil. I would revise at maybe 3 mil,759,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I guessed 1/2 mil I have no idea,1793,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
for that size it 30,1312,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
its art i would think in the double digits,927,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I guessed 4.5 million,1360,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I'm thinking 2-3 mil,1033,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
"that's true, it's large",75,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
our guesses are very varied,2040,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
Maybe 45 million,1312,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
it is small. I may go up to a mil,1793,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
It os a larger painting so higher prive,1046,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
Anyone truly keep up with this type of art?,1360,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
its not the size,927,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
its what the picture is painted on.,927,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
ahhh...to be RICH....what's that Liiike??,545,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I have no idea either guessed 4 mil,120,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
i think size is a factor,75,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
3 mil sounds respectable,443,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
It the artist,1312,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
i'm still thinking 3-4 mil,759,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
pastels give a different value than chalk or oil,927,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I'm now gonna say 2 mil,1793,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
"It's charcoal on paper, not an actual painting. Thought that might make a difference.",88,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
"I'm not sure, but it's also not a known drawing, right?",1994,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
"Because its size, style and artistic type, I think it should be sold for 1 million dollars",1398,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
"I'd say only $100,000",1338,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
i'm sticking with my $3m,954,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
it part of them,1312,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
Looks like 3-5 million might be a good guess?,1360,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I know so.e other paintings are a lot higher,1046,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
3 mil sounds good. Just pure guess.,1033,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
"I'm probably way low, but I'm staying at 2.5",735,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
It's a charcoal on paper not an actual painting,1338,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
i would think 10 or higher.,927,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
"that's a good point, he's most famous for his paintings",75,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
"has to be at least a mil for a van gogh, even if it is only a charcoal drawing",759,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
35 to 5 million,1312,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
"it's the artist, the type of paint",927,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
"Yeah, the name alone is valuable too.",1994,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
Still has his name so that always commands a premium,1360,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
Ill revise to 3 million,443,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
"i'm sticking to 1.5 mil, final.",1793,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I know one sold for 111 million,1046,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
this was a per painting,1312,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
I stick to 4.5,1360,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
its the media and the artist for sure.,927,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
so confused what to do,2040,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2
probably going to be a record,735,gJPrrCrxWYghxwctt2

Hello,776,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1
It makes sense syria had more than somalia,820,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1
Hello,509,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1
2000,186,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1

I think so too,1319,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1
"too little info to provide an estimate, but Syria likely has more",1181,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1

I put 1000,776,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1

I put 900,932,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1
1250,1203,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1
I would guess 1500,458,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1
How many were there really,509,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1
syria is like less than half the size of somalia,678,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1
Think syria is worse,509,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1
2000,1998,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1
more like 1/3rd of somalia,678,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1
I'm staying at 500,79,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1
The US has troops in Syria. They are at war.,471,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY1

Hello,1079,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
Hello,999,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
must be more since it is a war zone,635,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
a lot more,635,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
hi,564,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
There is so much the new reports how can we trust them,1829,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
Hello,999,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
I think there would be just as many in syria,1243,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
TRUE,635,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
I think more,554,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
only so much gets reported,635,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
"Given the level of conflict, there are likely to be a lot, unfortunately",520,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
at least as many as syria,564,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
I was way off then,999,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
i went with slightly more,1127,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
Who guessed what?,1084,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
"I think way more than Somalia, right?",1013,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
I think less due to size,1829,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
"i said more but not sure how many estimated 1,008 but can go higher",393,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
"I went with a lot more, 1200 or so",554,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
500,1829,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
I can understand thinking there was more,1243,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
976,1127,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
I.m going a lot higher,564,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
i said 5000 but no idea,756,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
Hi i guessed 700,345,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2

Me too 1240,1084,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
Guessed 10,999,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
My guess was very low,837,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
same,1958,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
i did 8,1958,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
at least 1800,564,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
My guess was absolutely low,1065,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
the issue is we only know what we are told about the damage of their government,1243,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
I went below since its attacks of military against civilians and not accidental deaths caused by conflict,1079,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
"My guess was lower, but still substantial",520,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
changing to higher is probably closer,635,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
I dont know what to put hahaha,1065,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
not sure how much,1829,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
news would be better if it was not filtered,1243,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
May should have guessed higher,1084,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
absolutely,1065,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
I concur,1065,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
I'm sticking with my original guess 1200,554,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
that sounds great,1065,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2
I’m upping mine to 1200 -,393,GKgGn23YNhSz5EBkY2

"I don't think it was more than 200,000.",912,gMmjyE3E8m63wigyN1
anybody who really thinks they are certain can tell us how you knew it?,604,gMmjyE3E8m63wigyN1
need more info to make an accurate guess,1949,gMmjyE3E8m63wigyN1
Uncertain,25,gMmjyE3E8m63wigyN1
just an average 150000,1419,gMmjyE3E8m63wigyN1
not sure,238,gMmjyE3E8m63wigyN1
averages look like 135000 when all our answers are in,1817,gMmjyE3E8m63wigyN1

ok,238,gMmjyE3E8m63wigyN1

better to be higer or lower?,1069,gMmjyE3E8m63wigyN1

about half,192,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
I was at 4000,1089,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
im saying its higher because they get government money too,1811,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
i think its less than half,843,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
and private colleges are much higher,1811,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
TRUE,1089,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
"i guessed 14,500",1811,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
most goes to admin and presidents,192,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
I figured 1/3.,482,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
So revenue was what was made?,806,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
"Maybe, but I think colleges put alot of money into campus buildings and such, and that money isn't directly spent on instruction",515,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
yes most goes to admin and presidents not nearly as much is spent on instruction,843,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
I'm beginning to think it was more like 2500,262,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
3000?,1660,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
that was my original guess,843,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
"I guessed 1500. There are a lot of other expenditures to cover. President salaries, building maintenance...etc",1970,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
I am gonna put 3500,806,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
i Agree with cLH,1114,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1
2500 its such a racket,843,gPBbdAxmpiyzWw5JL1

"Van Gogh's works go for a lot of money, but I think I guessed high at 40 million. I think that was the top bid for something else.",1263,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
I was low 1 million,219,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
i think we're probably low if under 50 mil,981,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
I said 1.5 mill,1992,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
less than 40 i think,449,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
but not based on anything but a guess,981,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
His stuff is really popular.,2009,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
Maybe 2 or 3?,1584,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
This isn't a typical VanGough work.  So I think it will go for more,243,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
50 million?!,1992,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
I am thinking more like 5 million.,1263,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
Maybe 2 million,1354,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
it looks like 4 mill is about a consensus?,449,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
20?,830,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
Higher is probably better.,2009,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
Higher is better,1263,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
4 million is good i think,348,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
20 seems high but is very possible,449,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
ok 4,1584,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
I wouldn't pay more than $2 mill,1992,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
I say at least 8 million but less than 20,243,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
anyone have one of his pieces? how much did you pay?,1694,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
we have a minute and a half to talk,449,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
1.5 million,1354,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
It is probably pretty rare!,2009,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
it is also quite small which might bring the value down,348,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
less than a minute to decide,449,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
"lol nshar, someone doing mturk has an original Van goh",981,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
I think it actually sold for 3.65 million,1263,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
"On second thought, I think that 1.5 is a little low",1992,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1

3.5 it is,348,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
Going with 3.5 mill,1992,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
"Someone clearly looked it up, let's go with the 3.65",2010,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1
Wild guess! :),2009,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL1

google places a recent drawing of his at 8.4 mil,392,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
another of his sold for 39.7 million,258,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
It is a nice picture,1178,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
To me all those expensive paintings look alike,847,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
6 mil seems a lot for a charcoal sketch,123,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
I think I underestimated at 3 million,184,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
6 million is a little too much I think,1344,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
might of costed 66 mil for all we know,714,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
Yeah I caught it after hitting send,1399,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
how much for a painting do you reckon?,123,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
It's a charcoal print not painting.,1986,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
"it is a nice pic, and VVG's work is very coveted and popula",97,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
this is true but it's still done by a pretty loved artist,714,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
"It's a pretty good size, which contributes I should think",123,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
cost must of been way higher than we estimated,714,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2

I am going to go with what I researched and say around 8 mill,392,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
lol Static,1344,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
3 .5,319,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
3 mil sounds reasonable,714,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
I might have under estimated the cost,1178,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
I think a lot of the cost would be attached to the name,123,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
But it is mostly his color usage that he is renowned for.,1986,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
4.5 mil sounds good to me,148,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
no idea on how much charcoal pics are worth,97,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
My guess is it is about. 3-5,1399,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
$5 million,847,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
"agreed, its the name attached to it",1910,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
Ill go up to 3.5,860,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
3 or more,97,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
yeah 3,714,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
4.5 mil,1910,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
so we're hovering around 3.2,123,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
The name is why it would be worth anything.,1986,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2
Too much,847,hafnksS77DJYaCkgL2

I guessed 6mil,232,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
i said 4 million,1234,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
0.75,230,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51

3 mil,339,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
4,862,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
I said 3,1036,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
2,35,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
It is a Picasso but not a very famous one.,1923,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
I said 1.5 million,1500,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
I have no clue art's crazy,895,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
i dont think it would be that much,85,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
2 mil,1032,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
it could be 120,1351,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
not one of his more famous paintings,35,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
Even if its not famous it may be more than that,1234,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
He has had paintings that have sold over 50 million (in pounds) in the past couple years,1526,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
I know nothing about art either,285,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
20 mil,1032,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
I don't think any painting has ever sold for 120 m,1923,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
i think maybe 100 mil at least,1351,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
29 million,1704,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
I don’t know art either,1500,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
25 mil,1351,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
i like 25 mil,85,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
Paintings are only worth what someone is willing to pay for them.,35,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
ok,1351,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
I just know they tend to go for high prices,895,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
It looks like most of us put between 1.5 and 4,1923,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
the highest painting by picasso sold in 2018 was 68 million,230,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
how large was the 68 million painting?,1966,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
But that was a well known painting,1923,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
Wow,285,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
so 25 mil?,1351,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
"25 million might be good, i may have lowballed at 5 million.",355,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
I'd say 13 is our mean prediction,339,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
i like 13,85,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
25 seems appropriate,1526,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
Im going with 6 million,232,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
That’s a lot of money for a paintings,1500,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
it sold for 29 million,1704,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
29?,230,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
If you want to go with the wisdom of the crowd it's 13,339,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
29.6 to be exact,1704,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
25 does seem a little on the low side,895,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
there you have it,862,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
I'll go with 13 or 14,1923,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
u sure,1351,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
I like 29,895,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51
so 29.6 then,1351,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M51

Art is expensive.,1362,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52

ppl pay thru the roof,670,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
Hey,917,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
i agree,1388,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
I said 20 but that was a pure guess,1690,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
are we suppose to come up with a group amount or just chat?,1929,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
I think this is Picasso's Mona Lisa and it sold for about 100 million,484,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
Picasso - 20-30 mil,1370,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
"Piece looked basic, buyers be mad.",1362,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
oh my,1377,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
yes.. Itsmee. I think my initial 4 mil is low,1929,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
Maybe go with 15? Kind of in the middle of all our guesses,1342,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
Ima go with 30 mil,1370,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
oh my Bobo,1929,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
yeah,1377,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
i dont know,1388,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
I think I am gonna go up,1929,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
yeah somewhere in the 20-30 million range seems likely,1673,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
"Well, some of his sold for 100 million",478,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
30 mill sounds good,1831,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
10 million,1935,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
I gonna say 10 mil,1929,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
I'm staying over 100,813,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52

I even think it is higher than 150,813,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
30 is too low,329,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
I am gonna go with 10 million,1929,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52
haha yes it is,1388,i5LXjWwrLCaayP6M52

way higher,368,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd1
"1000, I guess a round number works best. Baltimore seems like it’d be worse off",2023,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd1

"Can't find a total on the GVA website, just # of events by date & city.",1549,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd1

Hi!,1473,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
Hello,1327,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
i had no idea,1634,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
although I think it's less than Baltimore,1906,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
Hi!,630,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
1567 was my guess,1634,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
I thought it was less,977,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
1200 was my guess,630,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
philly seems pretty violent,1575,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
i went with 1000,732,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
no idea,1494,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
Slightly less I would think,1971,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
I thought maybe 950?,1473,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
i was guessing higher,1575,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
I said 205,287,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
I guessed less because of population,878,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
"I said 800, it's gotta be less than Baltimore",375,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
Yeah I think it’s less too but not sure exactly,1859,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
I guessed 800,555,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
I assume it'll be more than Baltimore. I said 1300,2011,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
Hey everyone.,1011,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
I said 800 also,878,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
I said 1000 also,977,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
"I said 750, my reasoning was similar to everyone else's",1906,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
"I'd guess more than Baltimore, but I don't really know",1327,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
800 is probably closer,1906,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
Less than Baltimore? Philly is awful,2011,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
1040,1494,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
less people are in baltimore than philly?,1634,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
i think baltimore has more crime than philly,1906,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
I live on the other side of pa. So no clue. Lol,287,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
I said 1058.,1011,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
Baltimore and philly are bad. I guessed 1100,1971,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
Pittsburgh is bad. Lol,287,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
940,1494,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
philly has twice as many people,1634,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
That's what I was thnking--that the number might be a little less in Philly?,1473,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
according to google Baltimore has a higher crime rate,630,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
II GUESSED in the 800s,915,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
"batman, that's true, i didn't think to adjust per capita",1906,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
so it might be more but a lower crime rate overall,1906,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
30 secs,287,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
I also just hear a lot more about gang violence in balt vs philly,878,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
"Higher crime rate, doesn't mean more incidents",2011,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
So what do you all think?,1473,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
Just more per person,2011,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
i say 1313. but a total guess,1634,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2
1200,630,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd2

I don't think Philadelphia has as much violent crime as Baltimore,684,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
"I think Philly is a bigger city too, which is also why I guessed more",468,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
Don't think it was more than Baltimore,888,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
baltimore has higher crime,8,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
I think crime rate is high everywhere,993,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3

I think it is probably a lot lower than we have guessed,993,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
i think they are similar,215,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
I wasn't sure about the crime rates either,1784,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
Hifher,9,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
Hifher,9,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
Higher,9,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
I think I guessed to high,1231,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
phillly should be lower than baltimore,8,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
Philly is a bigger city though,1784,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
Probably around 1000,1507,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
Baltimore is a bit smaller and does have more nice areas,894,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
you have to consider that all the events involved at least one person,1649,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
I think I will stay at 1000,993,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
Ok haven’t been to either. I will guess much lower.,11,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
I think that is a safe guess,993,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
Maybe 900,684,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
probably more when you include passers by,1649,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
philly population is 1.5 m baltimore is 600k,1561,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
I may go 850 or 900,1231,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
gang violence,1649,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
I will probably say 1000,1784,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
Yeah I'll stay at 1000 too,4,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
staying at 1000,993,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
"Isn't Maryland one of those gun-phobic ""free cirminal fire"" states?",888,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
no higher than 500 I'd say,1649,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
probly just under 400,1649,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3
"I think there is likely a bit more because Philly is bigger. Baltimores may be higher based on population, but the number itself might be bigger in Philly.",96,ikStGojn5PnLJdfxd3

Philly is less than baltimore,1449,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
whats up,1081,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
but still high,1682,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1

camden is right over the river and isn't nice,1682,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1

I put 900,497,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
i put a little less,1682,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
It might be higher,897,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
Philly I’d definitely less. Baltimore is very high,563,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
i live close to both. Balt is no good,1449,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
it's less,1126,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1

i put 800,1964,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
i do,1682,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
I think Philadelphia is bigger and just as problematic so I kinda went high,1130,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
Baltimore is one of the highest crime cities in the US,709,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
600,147,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
I think Philly is less also. Baltimore is one of the worst,1984,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
I put 1000 as well,897,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
I think 900-1000 sounds about right,1130,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
1150,1984,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
I put 850,709,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1

1223,571,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
1250,1081,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
I don't know the area so I just guessed,897,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
I live an hr between both.  100% Philly is safer,1449,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
wow I feel like I was way off,659,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
I just guessed also,571,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
maybe 700,1126,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
Baltimore makes the news more,1984,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
true that,147,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
Maybe 800 or so is a lot closer,1130,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
are guns an issue in philly? maybe there are more sword events,1964,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
lol,709,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
ive been to both cities this year and philly is is better,1682,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
I know philly I’d safer too. How much lower is the question,563,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
I have changed my mind now I think it is less,571,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
990,470,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1
800-900,1449,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc1

"I guessed Philly would have slightly more at 1300, but I wasn't entirely sure",795,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
I would assume Baltimore has more crime,313,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
i think baltimore is more violent than philly,457,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
i said 600,1823,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
Philly is bigger,499,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
985,744,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
"Has to be a lot less than Balto, I am thinking half?",1944,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2

"Baltimore is a very crime ridden city, more than Philly",854,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
I said 875,313,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2

"Philly has a bigger population, so I assumed more events (I guessed 1300).",86,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
Baltimore is the pits of the universe,1965,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
I think philly has more people but baltimore has more crime,1256,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
i said 1100 in philly,1729,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
I would say less,313,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
I said 1000,1179,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
so maybe 1200 or 1300?,1256,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
I said 450 in Philly,854,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
I said 1300,1400,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
i said 637,457,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
1300 seemed like a good guess to me,795,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
Thinking 5 or 6 hundred,1944,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
But it looks like we're all guessing,457,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
TheI would be ok with 600,313,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2
600 is good,854,iMBzoATbaiNdc9ttc2

I was a bit confused about that part.,846,Jm6oHSCDxr8fa9RwM1
"120,000 here",961,Jm6oHSCDxr8fa9RwM1
it says they exceeded 100k,1603,Jm6oHSCDxr8fa9RwM1
if the product is good they'll get more funding than they expect,1432,Jm6oHSCDxr8fa9RwM1
Clubs and dance venues are popular so funding shouldn't be too difficult,189,Jm6oHSCDxr8fa9RwM1
500k seems about right to me,1432,Jm6oHSCDxr8fa9RwM1

really?,189,Jm6oHSCDxr8fa9RwM1

Hmm.,846,Jm6oHSCDxr8fa9RwM1
"over, I said 80000",189,Jm6oHSCDxr8fa9RwM1

yep,189,Jm6oHSCDxr8fa9RwM1

If they made so much extra why are they doing it again?,961,Jm6oHSCDxr8fa9RwM1
150k sounds reasonable,189,Jm6oHSCDxr8fa9RwM1
but yeah I suppose I was way too high,1654,Jm6oHSCDxr8fa9RwM1

"yeah, i just guessed and figured momentum would slow down once it was over the goal",1498,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
"Hmm, maybe I'll change it to 175,000",1846,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
150k seems reasonable,978,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
I'm comfortable with going with 150k,18,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
over their goal,1410,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
if thousands are sold I'm guessing they were pretty expensive so I like 150 or higher,933,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
150k sounds good,1094,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
"it said that they exceeded their goal, but I almost said 200k",1924,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
"Yeah, I agree about 150, since they didn't talk about having stretch goals or anything",1795,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
i agree,1410,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
1,1105,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
"Yes--I agree--they slow down after goal is met, so I went with 150K.",1474,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
what do we think is reasonable,1924,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
150 is reasonable,1105,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
150k makes sense to me,1498,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
I'll agree with 150k,1924,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
cool,933,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
Me too,1835,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
Yeah,1941,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
great,1410,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
That was my first gut--150K,1474,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
I'll change it to 150k,1924,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
ok,1096,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1
thank you,174,kaa3uGM7nWD3TFD3s1

Hi all,220,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
Hello,1174,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
Haven't a clue on this....,1714,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
Hello,340,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
I guessed 60K,73,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
hey,1616,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
Hi,1597,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
What did you guys put,135,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
I think the music industry is booming,1881,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
hello,1798,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
Hello,902,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
i put 10000,1144,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
hi,1813,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
HEy,1899,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
i guessed way low - 5k,1616,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
so my thinking ist hat this would have no trouble raising this money becuase of the offer of equity,220,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
I don't think it's a lot,340,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
15000,1798,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
I guessed 25000,1301,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
"I guessed 5,000 but feel its to low",1881,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
1 put 60k,902,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
"I put $5,000. I can't imagine that many people want to physically go somewhere to hear a new song.",1174,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
don't think it was funded,1458,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
i just don't know if you can go over the cap,220,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
20000,1714,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
Hi guys,1631,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
I put 35000,135,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
"I would guess about 15,000",1881,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
i also put 60000,220,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
i have no idea what this app even means,1144,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
25000,1899,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
i think it's a dumb idea,1616,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
i put 25k,1813,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
a stake in the company is a huge incentive,220,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
JUST GUESSING,592,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
No way to make money,340,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
I think it is about right considering,1301,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
I think its not going to be to profitable,1881,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
"Reff, it sounds like Pokemon GO, but with music",73,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
Doesn't sound like a very convenient app.,1174,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
"hi,   nt guess was 10,000 but i am very unsure.",686,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
maybe 20000,1798,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
"maybe 15,000",1881,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
i agree that it'll be hard to monetize,1616,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
people are lazy... why woudl they do to locations to listen to music,1144,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
i put 10000,1144,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
25000,1301,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
people want convenience,1881,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
"I guessed, the app sounded lame",639,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
15K seems to be a nice median,1714,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
This would require more effort than just using a regular music app,1174,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
"15,000",1881,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
15-20K seems about right,1458,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
it sounds like fun,1301,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
seems too high,1616,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
if still maybe a bit high,1458,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
so to me it seemd like tinder with music.. you could go to th espot and meet people,220,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
some would consider it fun others a task,1881,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
i think it'd be hugely successful,220,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
"it would be fun initially, but the idea would wear off. Maybe the initial interest would generate about 15k",1144,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
It's a chore,340,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
"It's like GO, but with music",73,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
then die off,1144,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
i think people will like it,1301,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
probably depends on if the persons asking for money know people who tend to support them because they are friends,686,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
It is the UK after all ;),1714,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
Im not convinced it would be successful,1881,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
I'd be surprised if it raised anywhere near 30k,1174,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
Fun stuff huh,1631,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
"I wouldn't go over 20,000. i don;t wanna travel to hear the songs",1798,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
it might be successful,1301,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
maybe it'd hit 10k,1616,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
right?,1144,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
i would not donate,686,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
WHAT IF LOCATION IS STRONGLYDISLIKED,592,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
me either,1616,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
I think 10 or 15,1881,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
"i put 10k, but based on what everybody else says... maybe 15k?",1144,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
neither would I,1458,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
"i would donate, i like it",1301,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
so 15 K?,73,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
yea 15k,1144,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
14k,340,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
I can see 10k but not much more than that. 15k is a bit of a stretch,1174,Kb5Lyvt5kpcoS5YQD1
So what is everyone thinking?,1349,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
250000?,140,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"Hello, what do you think is a good guess?",181,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
I feel like they got an extra 150000 pounds,1113,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
I put 175000,181,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
I put 250000,720,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
150000,1987,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"my guess was 125,000",1349,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
So 250 total,1113,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
150000,1601,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
I had an initial guess of 175000,48,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
That's what I said. 25000,1195,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"500,000",1043,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
125000,1926,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
I also put 250000,1547,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
150000,323,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
It just seemed like a good number,720,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"I think the product is kind of crap, you go to a rave for the scene",1349,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
I said 112000,1855,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"I think £3,00,000",859,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
I put in way more I think I may have to change my answer,1664,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"I believe they raised the 100,000",661,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
I said 250000,1123,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"300,000????",1349,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"terri, it said they exceeded their goal of 100,000",1349,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
They did raise 1000000,1987,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
yup,720,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
100000,1987,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"should we just round it to 200,000?",181,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
I put 325000,779,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
Oh. You're right. Okay,1195,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
that's quite an increase,1349,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
texas that sounds good,1987,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
Doubling the investment would be a huge increase,1855,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
I can go for that,720,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
I am good with 200000,48,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
200000,1195,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
double the initial amount?,1349,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
£325000 ok,859,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
double!,48,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
triple??,1349,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"oh thats great....... so i would say maybe they raised close to 500,000",661,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"200,000 sounds good",1043,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
jeepers,1349,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"ok, 200000",1123,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
200000,48,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
Yeah,720,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
you guys sure believe in this product,1349,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
250000,1664,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
200000,48,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"haha, nope, 150000 max",1855,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
200000,859,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
200000,48,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"i'm good with 150,000",1349,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"200,000 good",323,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
that's 50% over expecting,1349,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"I don't believe in the product, but others supposedly do",1987,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
I'll go with 200000,720,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
Lower than 200000,1926,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
its an awesome product especially if it worked,661,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"i did 150,000",1601,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
175000,1664,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
?,1664,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
that's a but IF,1349,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
200000,48,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
I did 125000,1926,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
25% over seems reasonable in my book,1349,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"I did 250,000",1113,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
200000 would be correct,859,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
sounds like they met their goal,661,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
terri they exceeded it,1664,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"Really, any guess is good.  There is no telling",48,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
NA,543,Lhn6zceQg6miTJCzv1
"Well, what did everyone think?",151,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
I put 150k. What does eveyone else think?,1072,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1

105000,741,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
"I guessed 150,000 anybody else?",601,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
I also guessed 150k,561,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
125000,1644,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1

I put 99k,467,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
"I said 200,000",644,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
I put 500k,1580,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
"200,000",861,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
Sounds like 150K is the most common answer,1450,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
I put 500k,151,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
Also put 150k,1982,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
I estimated 1.5 million as it was in exchange for equity,1832,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
I put 65k,1983,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
I said 175000,1617,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
huh?,968,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
1.5 million? why,968,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
Yeah 150k seems to be the most common,1072,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
But I really thought 200000,1617,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
So nobody has a clue right?,601,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
Final answer should probably be between 150-250k,1450,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
I would agree that 150k is a good guess,861,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
They already sold thousands of units so it's possible to raise more than half a mil,467,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
right. no clue!,1617,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
"that guy who kickstarted ""make potato salad"" got millions",861,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
No clue,1580,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
Doesn’t really give enough info. Just hoping it’s they are good at tasing funds,1982,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
I'm probably going to go with 250K,1450,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1
"these things often seem to double easily, but I don't know about more than that",1617,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1

If they had a baseline goal then i would say they had data for estimating it in the 100k ballpark in the first place.  I wouldn't estimate too fdrastically different,1072,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB1

I'd say 200000 pounds,511,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
dang alot of yall went way over,654,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
"120,000 conservative",585,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
Yeah,791,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
Lol not over the ask,117,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
200000 pounds seems reasonable,1070,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
I said 250k since they've sold thousands of units already. must be somewhat popular,822,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
hmm,791,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
100001 is a safe bet,985,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
Seems midrange at least,791,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
it's over 100000 exceeded goals,809,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
I said 150000,1267,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
yeah i mean i just think it would be in the 100000's range,654,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
"lol like price is right, $1.",791,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
We have a minute left. What are we going to say? 150 or 20000 pounds?,1070,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
well under 200k,585,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
"i think 150000 is reasonable. if it is that popular and they are seeking more and they asked for 100,000 i thought half of that as exceeding was good if it was popular",1383,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
130000,283,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
I think they doubled it,638,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
175000,1624,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
150000,377,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
h m m,791,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
i think 175k,654,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
i also think 150000,809,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
I’m going to put my final answer as 175000 I think,1509,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
I say 180,822,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
i thought 200000 was too high,985,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
lets say 175 then,654,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
150000 sounds reasonable,638,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
Thousands of units sold,447,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
175 sounds fair. in between teh too commons guesses,945,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
I agree,1624,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
Do we have to come up with the same answer?,791,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
175?,1070,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
Okay let’s go 150k,117,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
I like 175,447,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
i say 150k,985,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
>.>,791,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
160000?,283,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
we are coming up with how much they ranged,654,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
150k let’s go,117,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
Aight.,791,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
i thik,654,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
who knows,1383,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
lol,791,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
150 sounds good,1383,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
"over goal, which was 100k, can't be too much over",585,maJdGJzHrqa9tR7MB2
"I think at least 110,000",1059,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
why,802,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
150000,1963,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
usually crowdfunding campaigns either get no funding or full funding,399,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
i agree maybe 120000,1774,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
interesting....,898,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
200000,1391,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
125000,1236,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"Hi, I think its 250000",1848,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
let's average it out?,898,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"I figured about 110,000",742,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
succesful prior funding,802,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"I think they might have raised 150,000",69,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"I estimated 150,000",1059,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
I agree with Jones,824,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
3000000,115,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"no real reason for number, just seemed like a good guess",1963,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
300000,1530,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
but doesn't say what backers get,802,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
so it's hard to say,802,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"probably at least 100,000",974,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
12000,1848,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
100000 sounds right,953,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
all seem low,1236,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"I think 110,000",1444,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
yeah is there an incentive for backers,1774,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"Hmm, my guess would be 150,000. They have only sold thousands of units, not hundreds of thousands etc.",1585,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
or how many thosuands already sold,1059,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
yup,1848,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"110,000",369,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
200000,1236,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
we price is righting this lol,898,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
lol,1774,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
110000 is good,1848,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"said they exceeded 100,000",1059,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
true!,1530,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
right,802,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
way low,1236,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
exceeded could be 101000,1774,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
makes sense,1848,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"oh yes, exceeded",974,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
but did not say wildly exceeded,1059,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
sure,1848,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
at least 200000,1530,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
This is a new trend and people will jump on it to be the first to have it,115,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"150,000",974,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
Yeah not far exceeded,369,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
could be,1236,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
how can we really know,1848,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
we don't,1530,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
you don't,1236,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
we are guessing / estimating,974,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
just a game,1236,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"I submitted 150,000 but am now starting to think the answer may be a minimum of 200,000",69,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
then i'm going with 120000,1848,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
are people more willing to back once met?,802,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
200000,1236,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"im going with 150,000",974,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"I think I am doing 140,000",1059,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
"The wording say they sought an ""additional"" 100,000",69,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
if not it shouldnt be too high,802,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
NA,91,mHKgRvrmppcdn5qGm1
Hello All,1209,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
does 75000 make sense?,1884,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"I just guessed 200000, double the amount....",832,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"115,000",1462,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"well, we know they exceeded their goals, so it's higher than 100k right?",612,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
Agreed,1975,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"no, because it said it exceeded the amount",832,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"I guessed 200,000",1786,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"I guessed 250,000.",576,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
I guessed more,1975,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
150000,294,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
I guessed they made a little over,1499,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"Okay, gotcha",1884,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
so 75000 can't be right,832,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
200000,1205,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"I put 175,000",1703,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
so closer to 200000,1499,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
200000,191,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
130000,1357,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"I guessed it wasn't terribly above, and said 120000",1189,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"Hello, I think it’s around 300000",1796,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
i said 150000,612,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"I think 250000 to 300,000 could be good",1703,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
It really could be any of these....,832,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
lol yeah it could be,612,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
really just a shot in the dark,612,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
They said they exceeded their goal,1703,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
Totally agree with the 250000-300000,1796,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
There is just no way to know the exact answer...,832,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"Yeah, normally I'm able to do some research for these but there's not enough info",1940,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
i guessed an additional 25000,1209,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"It's tough with nothing else to go on, though we do know it sold well",1189,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"I guessed 20,000",1975,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
300000 SOUNDS GOOD,2008,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"exceeding the goal, i am guessing 200000",191,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
What is the concensus?,1703,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"right, before questions had a right and wrong but this is just guessing pretty much...",832,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"I said 500,000 lol, thinking 2 or 300,000 now",1167,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
Seems like they've been successful every step of the way so I think double the goal is reasonable.,576,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
300000 is good for me,1796,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
think im going to go in the middle and say 200000,612,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
200000 then,1884,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
300000,2008,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
I agree....It could be anything,1703,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
200 sounds good,1462,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
200000 sounds reasonable,1499,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
200000 sounds good to me,1209,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
me too,191,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
Me too,1975,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
I'm feeling 200000ish but really anything over is legit,1940,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
"200,000 but I am feeling 300,000",1703,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1
exactly,832,N8CknFDn96pdtsdkH1

I'm guessing that they got the whole amount.,748,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1

what do you think,312,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
Hi,1249,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
i guess 3000,92,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
"Hello. I guessed 10,000",1386,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
no idea,92,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
"Hi, I'm a pessimist I guessed 2500",1946,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
I guessed 10000,1340,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
I guessed 10000 also,1736,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
with the success of pokemon go probably a lot,881,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
Hello,1157,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
I think 13000,312,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
i guessed 15000,1191,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
i like you kay,92,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
I think 85700,1295,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
I said 20000 as an estimate,1201,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
It sounds to me like it would be popular.,748,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
i really don't know what i based this off of,92,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
"I guessed that they went over to 35,000, thinking people wanted a share",1026,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
10000 sounds goo,1157,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
10000,681,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
I think the whole amount. Sounds like it would at least be enticing,1249,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
Looks like 3 people said 10000,1308,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
I think the 35% needs to be used to arrive at 85700,1295,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
"If given the opportunity, though, given all of these guesses, I might go down to 20,000.",748,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
I think people wouldn't want to do it that much because you would have to go to the physical location to hear the songs,1736,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
"It is a perception thing, I can guess...",1201,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
"I'll go with 10,000 up from my 2500",1946,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
"I thought higher than 30,000 since it seemed like it would be very popular",2026,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
That’s true Shelly,1026,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
I think the hassle of having to go to a physical location would deter people.,1386,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
I agree with shelly and bigcats,1946,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
"Well, it is music",1201,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
"i go with 10,000 too.",868,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
"Maybe, but people might still think it's a cool idea and invest.",748,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
i guessed higher too,881,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
I agree with 10000,1157,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
"I agree with 10,000",1386,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
"I'm staying with 10,000",1308,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
10000 here also,1191,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
10000 seems like the most agreed on,92,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
10000 sounds good,681,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
Did you see how many people went out when Pokemon Go was first released,2026,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
"maybe, but there are so many wasy ways to download it",1736,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
I agree 10000,312,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
10000,1946,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
I thought it was a weird concept.  I'm sticking with 10000,1340,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
Okay 10000,1295,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
but shelly and kay rule,92,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1

"I guess everyone is going 10000, but I will stick with the 20000",1201,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
Okay sounds good to me,1157,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
10000,1308,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
Might go for 15.,748,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
im way outnumbered lol,881,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
"I think it is higher, but I'll go with it",1295,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1
Is there a correct answer?,1201,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou1

Hi,1809,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou2
20000,1528,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou2
I said 10000,606,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou2
"15,000",379,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou2
I put the full amount because I think the app would attract a lot of attention.,962,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou2
15000,1185,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou2
1000,1488,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou2
I thought the whole amount,101,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou2
who is the audience for the app,715,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou2
"I think it depends on whether the app is ""cool"" or not",1918,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou2
"I said 30,000",1809,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou2
I put the full amount too,757,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou2

10500,1488,nHktCMm4d586c5Wou2

hi,695,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Hey,2007,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
So the game,55,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
"yo, what's the population of Somalia and Yemen",159,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
So this is a weird question to bo honest,352,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Hi,1818,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
hello,1990,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Hi,1782,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
What does everyone think,626,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Hahaa super wierd,1611,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I guessed similar to Somalia,367,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Hello,882,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I have no idea about these numbers,1818,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
"No idea, I just put a number",1138,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Maybe 841,55,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Is yemen more dangerous than Somalia?,352,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I guessed 350,1611,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I have no idea,780,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Can't be sure,367,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Im clueless honestly,1782,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I guessed 740,352,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
"I said 1412, just throwing a number out there",965,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Can't be as much.,1611,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I guessed 340,1818,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
"Yemen population is 11,031,386",159,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Probably a lot,780,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I guessed 200 but after thinking about it I think its way more,626,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
i guessed 600,128,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Somalia pop?,1611,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Alright,55,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
"I mean SOmalia is 11,031,386",159,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I guessed 400,2002,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
population is a good indicator,367,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
"i just picked a number, i feel like yemen has more conflicts than somalia but could be wrong",724,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I said 207 lol,1782,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
500,55,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Yemen is in the middle of a war with Saudi Arabia so it is more dangerous than Somalia,695,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
250,1990,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Is there more political conflict in Yemen though?,352,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
"Yemen is double: 27,584,213",159,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
500 maybe,55,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I'd say in the 1000's then,352,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
for sure,352,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I think it is probably similar to Somalia,780,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
So,55,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I'm thinking in the 1000s too,626,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
If Yemen is more dangerous,352,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
me too,724,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
1500?,159,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
"Yeah but its about targeting citizens intentionally.,",1611,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
"I guessed 400, but probably should have gone higher since Yemen is larger than Somalia.",882,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
841,55,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
155,1990,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
"Soooo whats our final answer, ladies and gentlemen?",1782,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Probably double Somalia?,2007,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Somalia isn't in a war,1611,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
1000,780,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
higher than 1000,367,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I'm thinking 1200.,882,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
1200,724,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
1412,965,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
1200ish,2002,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
841 then,55,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I have the impression that Somalia is more dangerous but I could be wrong,1818,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
sounds pretty good,367,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I'm thinking maybe 1500,626,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
1200,128,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
they just keep attacking civilians for no reason.,1611,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Why?,159,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
I think those numbrs are high,1818,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
same I don't think Yemen is as dangerous,1138,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
1150,1782,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
"I just read, there are banned weapons, landmines and all sorts of crazy stuff",352,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
this is hard with very little info,626,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
750,780,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
600?,1629,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
1100?,159,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
600,1138,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Im going with 1000-1500,352,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Yemen is a larger country. Not sure about population.,882,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Maybe 841,55,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
"Agreed, don't have enough information.",1818,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
1200,626,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
1200 sounds safe,159,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
660,942,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
1200,2002,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Sticking with 1200,882,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ1
Sup,1206,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
thoughts?,1592,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
hello,1953,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
My answer was a complete guess.,422,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
mine too,1764,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I wasn't sure but I guessed 200.,237,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
as was mine,903,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I'm thinking it's more because i think yemen has more people than somalia,1106,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I have no idea,922,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I think I threw 681,1206,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
Mines was a guess as well,1166,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I said 500,1764,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
No idea,688,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
guess here as well,815,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
"I guessed on my answer, I was unsure",949,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I'd assume it would be a high number due to the war that's been ongoing,289,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
i thought it was more than somolia,903,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I said 400,949,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I hink its more than Somalia with the ISIS,284,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
i said 1500,1106,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
"I'm thinking in the 1,000",688,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
"I said 420, thinking Somalia was more dangerous and more crazy than Yemen",1592,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
i tough emen had far more conflict,1953,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
i guessed way to high i think,815,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I guessed lower than Somalia but maybe I am wrong.,237,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
Maybe 600,1166,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I think it was less because that is a violent area.,1622,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I guessed closer to 1000 due to the war.,289,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I don't know much about events in Yemen.,237,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
so iwent with 2700 3 times as much,1953,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
what war?,1592,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
Since some of you know about foreign affairs I'm going with your guesses,1206,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I can see something closer to 1000,1764,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
Civil,1953,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
There's been an ongoing civil war for the past year and a half or so,289,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I unfortunately haven't kept up with much the conflict,949,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
So 1000 is the guess we are going with?,1166,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I think I should have guessed higher. My guess was probably way off!,237,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
i guessed close to 1000 as well,815,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
Yes they been in civil conflict  for decades,922,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
hmm... war doesnt intentionally target civilians... no?,903,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
I'm gonna say 1200,1206,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
My guess probably should have been higher,949,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
Yep. I'm thinking between 1000and 2000 now,1953,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
"500,000",1592,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
At least 800,326,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
that's a fact,1592,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
Oh wait we all have to agree,1206,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
What's the number,1206,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
12,1592,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2
1000,949,NHMWXTsgF46YwYkdQ2

"I guessed 1,000 but I have no clue.",1180,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
Hello?,900,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
Hi,765,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
Hello,1734,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
I guessed 1200,765,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
I said 1000,1505,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
I guess 900 but also no clue,1496,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
Hi,244,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
1245,647,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
Yeah I guessed 1100 but also no clue,1358,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
I said 400,187,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
I guessed 900,1245,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
I said 850,1734,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
I guessed roughly double,1266,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
I guessed 2000 but no clue either,244,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
i have no clue either. i was going to put 1000 but hten went with 950,725,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
841,1477,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
"Hi, I guessed 1200",1372,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
I guessed 200 sure I'm way off,1566,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
"I went 1500, but also mostly no clue - I think it's higher than Somalia",900,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
Does anyone actually have any insight or did we all just guess?,1180,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
is syria larger than Somalia,652,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
Syria is in the news but not Somalia so it's probably higher than 841,256,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
I guessed 550....but I think that may be low,556,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
I guessed 2000,1404,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
So we're avg about 1k to 1.2k,765,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
1500,1566,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
syria is maybe a quarter fo the size as somalia,1266,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
i would say maybe double?,652,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
i guessed that Syrian attacks would be higher than Somalian,725,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
"Definitely thought it would be higher than Somalia, though Somalia is ongoing civil war. but Syria is targeting civilians more specifically",1358,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
"(We have a larger force in Syria, so it does get in the news more)",900,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
More ISIS action in Syria,256,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
"Syria is in a state of violence right now, aren't they?",1180,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
"Syria is mostly terrorists, they gain nothing from attacking their own people....so I estimated 400....LOW",187,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
yup,900,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
Can we agree on 1500,765,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
I agree,1566,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
"syria has an active civil war, somalia is a largely failed state",1266,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
yes,1404,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
yes 1500,652,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
agreed,1496,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
yes 1500,1734,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
Kurds are considered civilians I think,900,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
I’ll go with 1500,1505,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
Yes,1245,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
sure. do we all go 1500?,1180,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
i think 1500 is probably good,1266,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
works for me,1358,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
sure,1477,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
1500 yes,1404,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
ok,256,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
That was quick,765,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
Yes,556,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
sounds good to me,725,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
1500 was my original guess,900,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
sounds good to me,244,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
I do believe Syria was higher than Somalia in 2018,1372,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
"That's why you're a doctor, DrT",1180,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
too high...sorry,187,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
Not that type of dr :-),900,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
"what do you think, angedave?",1180,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
do you have knowledge about foreign attacks like this?,1180,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
They are terrorists.....they gain nothing from killing their own citizens......,187,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
logic,187,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
other than the ones that oppose them?,900,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
Syria isn't just terrorism.,1358,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
"I would say at least 1500, more like 2000",1372,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s1
"I Put 1685,, what about you>",1343,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
what do you guys think?,246,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
"I really have no idea, but I am guessing it is a lot",833,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
I put 900,1865,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
115,1655,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
i put 1200,1553,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
I said zero,124,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
i put 1000,246,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
1000,1172,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
I put 500 but I'm guessing it's higher,494,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
I guessed on my answer and really do not have a clue,602,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
I guessed 900 as well,864,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
1800,833,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
"Less,",1192,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
I have no idea.  I put 921,1217,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
I put 820.  No clue,1581,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
Gotta be double the Somolia amount,1343,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
I guessed as well,808,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
2000,1367,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
900 here,1183,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
941,1845,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
i would think syria wouls have more,1553,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
may be much higher than 900,864,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
500 here,1542,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
It might be the same,808,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
"Cannot be less, mj",1343,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
So 841,808,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
gotta be double,1343,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
I think high,1217,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
"I figured less than Somalia. But depends on who is counting whom as ""civilians""",1655,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
it definitely has to be higher than somalia,1865,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
Somalia has no government.  Syria does.  Why would Syria be more?,124,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
double might be pushing it,1553,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
It's going to be high with everyone fighting everyone else,833,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
is there some kind of conflict in Somalia?,1367,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
Syria seems more dangerous,808,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
I think it is higher too,1845,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
I think high too,602,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
theres a lotta chaos in syria,1343,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
and civilians are potential isis members,1343,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
i dont think many are intentionally being targeted though in syria,1553,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
Perhaps 900,808,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
But are civilians the target?,124,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
Sorry I missed the detail that it has to be doubled?,1542,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
have been lots of hospitals targeted,1655,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
Targeted by whom?,124,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
Does it matter?,1655,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
for this exercise it's irrelevant,494,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
with everything going on in Syria im assuming the number would be higher,1865,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
this article says 446 vibilians were killed between sept 19 and oct 18 in 2016 if that gives any indication,1183,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
i don't think that's true about the hospitals. sorry,1553,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
446 in one month?,1343,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
civilians*,1183,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
yeah,1183,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
than hell yeah more than somolia,1343,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
So must be higher,808,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
I think at least 900 probably higher,1217,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2
i might go a little hight,1553,NzJHgWRuwwxp5QS3s2

I have zero clue here,1837,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"I put 2,500.",1194,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
Yemen is more violent than somalia right?,704,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I'm not sure,1366,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"I guessed 1250, but it was purely a guess",834,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
What does everyone think?,1893,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I put 650,746,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I don’t,121,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"I put 1000, but I thought that was low",996,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I was not sure at all and put 1100,1731,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
no clue,271,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I put 450,121,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I put 2500 too!,704,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
i said 250,1837,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
i put 5,998,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
i said 1000 but i guessed,270,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I admit I don't know much about this topic except that I've heard that Yemen is in a brutal civil war,1194,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
3000,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
Yemen is usually worse,1937,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
Yemen is MUCH more violent than somalia.,1464,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I honestly don't know a thing,1325,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I think Yemen is more volatile,1366,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"I guessed 1500, I have no idea......",947,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
pure guessing,1837,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I thought 500 but I have no idea. Thought less violent.,1893,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I know yemen has their own issues but I don't know how bad it is in comparison,746,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"Yeah, Yemen is getting hammered",996,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
500,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I guess 600,1325,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"it might be much higher,",704,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"I know there are armed conflicts in yemen, and it's been pretty volatile lately",834,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
Yeah so i think much higher than somalia,1194,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"Somalia is kinda chillin, isn't it?",996,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
600,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I'm guessing too but there is much more instability and unrest in Yemen.,1464,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
might change it to 1000,1837,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
Chilling lol,1937,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
maybe its 10 times more?,704,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
700,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
Targeting civilians?,121,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
Yeah question is how much more,1194,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
1100,1731,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I am going to guess 500 also,998,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I haven't seen much on the news about Yemen though,1366,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
Conflicts within for civilians though?,1893,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
10x might be extreme,1937,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"Yeah, but just how much civilians are being targeted is hard to tell",1325,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
10,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
They are having a civil war,1464,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"Well, I think it's def more than Somalia",996,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
20,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
25,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
Exactly. Hard to tell if civilians are targeted,1893,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
are we allowed to do research,1194,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
1000,1325,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
maybe 4 times more?,704,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
So can we use 850 as a base to start from?,996,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
650,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
bc they are saying 13 million displaced,1194,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
750,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
it's really really bad there now,1194,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
Their own government is killing civilians alongside insurgents.,1464,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
550,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
450,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
yeah i think at least 4x worse?,1194,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I would i said 1200,1937,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
250,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
1200,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"the question said 2018 though, not today",1366,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
looks like everyone is averaging to 500,998,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"2018 was bad, too",834,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I'd go higher,208,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
yeah but i researched 2018,1194,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
i still stick with 1100,1731,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
1000,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
maybe 3500?,704,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
It could have been the start of it so 500-1000,1325,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
500,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I said 1900,1464,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
this was goign on last year definitely,1194,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"2,400",208,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"Yeah, but that's last year, and I feel like I heard a lot about Yemen at the end of last year",996,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I might go with around 1000,121,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
yea 100 is sounding better to me know,1837,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
i think 2000 to 2500,1194,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
1200,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
509,717,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I want to say at least 1500,996,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
So we all agree more?,1893,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
1000*,1837,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
yes def more,1194,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
I agree with yellowdog,208,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
Yes,1937,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1

"Yeah, I agree",746,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
"yup, more",834,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1
Yes much more...,1325,oaxX2ELs7EZkrxsMY1

Helloooooooo!!,1819,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I was thinking 5000 also.,356,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I also thought 5000,47,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I think it's only about 1/3,1056,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
Really? That's incredibly high,1819,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1

iam thinking about 6000,1867,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
"My guess was 2,000",1024,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
5000 sounds good,853,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I was thinking 5000,1887,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I put about 3000,100,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
mayne 4000 would be a good middle ground,1724,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
"I have no idea, I feel like most money goes toward stupid other shit that is not teaching. 5k is good for me",870,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I was thinking of a number a bit higher - $7500,265,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
we all think not much,1680,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I put 6500,421,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
"I think, per student, much less is spent than anticipated.",1819,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I think its 2000 or even lower. the rest is spent on facilities,2036,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
Much lower,1819,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
TRUE,1724,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
i agree it is per student,1680,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
i said 1000,420,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
Middle ground qould be around 4000,1887,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I'm willing to go with the majority - $5000,265,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I think less than 1000 per student,1819,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
"shits all a scam, def lower",530,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I think about 2000,1097,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
Lots of overhead to run the school,356,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I think less than 2K,1819,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
what ever it is it is not worth it,1680,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I think less than $100,1819,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
think how much instructors make. I used to teach adjunct. Made about 2500 for four class,2036,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
per student,1819,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I doubt less than 1000,1887,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
under grad classes can have 200 students,1680,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I am changing to 3000,1724,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
"I doubt you're correct, Katt",1819,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
i am changing to 5000,1867,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
less,1819,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1

I'm lowering from 5000 to 3000,356,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
less,1819,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I don't  care,1887,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
"probably like 20,000",530,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
less,1819,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
I'll revise mine to 4000,265,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
less,1819,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
"maybe 1,000,00 honestly",530,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
less,1819,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
What?,1887,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
it depends on whether the infrastructure is included in the cost,100,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1
probably a billion,530,ouhBfMvYBay8QGXRY1

"they went way over, and kept the rest",629,pafCKwRCLGrvs2Sdm1
150000 sounds like a popular answer,1802,pafCKwRCLGrvs2Sdm1
20000,648,pafCKwRCLGrvs2Sdm1
I guessed double as well,1058,pafCKwRCLGrvs2Sdm1

at least half does make sense Ginger,1335,pafCKwRCLGrvs2Sdm1
"Maybe 200,000",1219,pafCKwRCLGrvs2Sdm1
they make more,629,pafCKwRCLGrvs2Sdm1

20002,1878,pafCKwRCLGrvs2Sdm1

I think somalia is in a worse situation right now,1913,qEXaS54FiyFscBmiv1

hi,1628,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
"I believe I remember this story, it was something like 30 or 35",1289,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
Hello. I guessed 2 million.,680,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
29.5 is the anser then?,1012,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
i think 1.2,1254,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
I guessed 21,1853,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
2.1?,64,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
I guessed 40,1060,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
i think 30,1628,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
I might have been way under then,1868,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
I said 2 million,1576,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
It sold for 29.5,799,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
29.5?,2029,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
I'm definitely way under on the price,885,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
i guessed 4.6 mill and thought i was high. haha,1852,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
i said 750k,1868,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
over 25 mil for sure,836,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
What's up everyone!,1012,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
yes thanks,2029,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
"Maybe it was a little bit more, but I'm pretty sure it was between 29 and 30 million",799,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
29.5 then?,1289,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
Mothra seems to know,1060,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
Wow,1576,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
29.5,1628,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
29.6,64,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
I guessed 2.5 million.,1012,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
29.5,1060,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
Seems reasonable to me: 29.5,1851,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
That sounds reasonableness to me,475,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
yes,2029,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
I was way off,1576,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
Alright. Thank you,829,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
"Yep, I am way not in that bracket",1868,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
la lampe is the name,836,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
29.6 MILLION,1758,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
i'll go with 29.5 mill,1852,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
Never saw a story on the sale,1868,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
"will go with 29.5 too, why not?",1060,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
it was late last year,1289,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
So we all agree 29.5,1576,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
15.5,1254,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
have a nice day everyone ^_^,1060,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
sounds fine by me,1868,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
works for me,885,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1
"my recollection was like 30 mil, but I think he's correct",1289,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb1

hi,1960,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
Yo.,508,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
Definitely a lot,1337,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I guessed 2.5 million,631,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
hi,1160,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
i said 2,1960,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I think picasso is famous,1491,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I guessed 3 mil but I think it may be too low?,800,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
1.3,1160,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
"I said 30 million. I can't imagine it sold for less than 10 million, it's picasso",636,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
he is,631,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I guessed 25,508,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
"I have no idea, I said like 20 million",306,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
i guessed 7,1491,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I said 23 million,987,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
200,1337,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
Any of yall familiar with oil paintings?,298,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
i said 6,98,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I said 32,407,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
"I said 5, but it may be low.",153,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
it sold for millions,1491,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I said 3 million but have no idea,133,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I am thinking much higher than I put,731,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I think I'm low at 2 million ...,380,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
Yeah haha,731,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
So somewhere between 1 and 200 lol,800,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
maybe >10,1556,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
difficult,1491,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
Lol,1337,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
i think above 10,1960,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I think if you're under 10m you're probably way too low. ha.,508,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
">10 for sure, >20 likely",636,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
Hard to relate to that much money,987,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
"Not an expert on this kind of thing, but i know we're talking millions.",153,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
who bought it?,1491,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I think I’m low after seeing this chat,1555,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
Alot of numbers ... hard to agree ...,380,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
me too,631,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
i like it!,1491,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I think I'll revise my estimate from $3m to $15-$20,800,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
a millionaire bought it,1491,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
they don't ever give you the correct answers on these hits lol so we'll never know,631,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
Yes,731,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
Sometimes oil paintings sell for 50m+ but it's hard to know what this one sold for. :p,508,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I am thinking >15 mil,731,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I like 20 million,987,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
So I split that to the 25m,508,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
I think I'll adjust my bid to a higher number ...,380,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
At least our range is getting more narrowed haha,800,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
when more than one person price goes up,1491,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
lol,306,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2
$15-25,800,qS3DiKTfu93nt77Eb2

Hello!,334,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Hi,1558,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Hello,2013,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Hey!,1270,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
i put 9000,1418,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
"I'm not sure about the rates of crime in either city, but I know that chicago is a lot bigger",13,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Hello,1330,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Hi,1833,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I guessed it was higher but I wasn't sure how much,328,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I think about 2000,500,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
1200,129,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Hello,395,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Hi,1173,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
i put 3k,1213,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
My number is way low,1783,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
yea chicago is alot,1418,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I just doubled it,334,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I put 100,1833,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
so I am going to make my estimate about 5 times bigger :D,426,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
1000,632,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I think 1600,1330,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
"I put 2631. Pretty much guessed, honestly.",1270,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
i said 4000,13,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I put 6000,2013,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
but i guessed high on mine,1418,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I'm going to triple mine,1783,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I think chi gets a bad rap,395,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
since chicago is like 4 (?) times bigger,13,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
about 6000 is probably accurate,426,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
i feel stuff always happens in chicago,1418,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I have higher,1833,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I know that crime rate is chicago is very high,1558,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I know Chicago is known for gun violence - I guessed  2500,1579,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
is the crime rate in baltimore high?,13,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
What happened? I didn't get time to do an answer. But I think it's probably 2000 plus.,1885,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Good going dudes,1330,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
That's a horrible amount of gun violence.,1270,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Yeah chicago seems to have a high crime rate,328,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
population of Baltimore: 600k. Population in Chicago: 2.7m,426,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Oh so it's probably like at least 3-4000,328,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I am going with a lower number because more police,500,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
3200 maybe,129,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Chicago is horrible,1833,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Chicago and Baltimore are both pretty high crime,426,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Chicago is not horrible...lol i live there,632,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Corrupt Chicago!,334,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Are any of you actual human beings or just chat bots?  Just askin'.,1783,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
i think 3000 is a good number,1418,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
so I figure just multiply by population,426,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I said 3400,1558,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
3500,1885,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Geez. So yeah we all low balling I guess.,1270,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Human,500,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I'm human.,1270,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
human,13,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
can a chatbot talk like this? Pretty clear this is a real one,426,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Awesome,1783,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
hi human here :),328,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
i am real,1418,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Human I am,334,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I am real,2013,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I think about the same,500,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Human,1885,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
"I'm going with 1500, my fellow human beings.",1783,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Maybe 50,1330,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
"I may also be devo and/or dancer, though :p",426,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
that's optimistic,13,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Bots have gotten. Pretty good though...,334,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I'm thinking around 2500-3000,1355,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Human,395,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Yeah I am human too :),1833,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I am going with 1300,500,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I am human,1330,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
i think 2175,1418,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I'm going 4500 now,632,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Will they give us the correct answer?,1558,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I am going to lower mine to 4000 from 6000,2013,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
my guess will be 2450,1885,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
gotta be at least 5k,426,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Don't know,1833,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I'm going to go with 2500,328,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Could it be in 300s?,129,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I hope they tell us!,1579,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
"52 weeks a year, averge 5 events a week",1418,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
3000?,129,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
Maybe 1500 but not much more,500,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
I think it is at least 100,1833,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
based on Baltimore,426,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
2998,1418,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1
definitely at least 100 ...,13,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh1

More I think,301,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
Hey,876,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
I think Chicago is more insecure than Oakland,1235,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
I guessed 2300,335,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
howdy doody,58,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
"So, just how violent is Chicago?",1468,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
450,1627,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
Chicago is a a very high chrime area i would think it was much higher than baltimore,1248,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
How many events u guys think have happened about gun,1098,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
"Chicago is a bigger city than Baltimore, so I put more",1772,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
Are we allowed to research?,1883,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
no way 450,1235,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
I think Chicago has more than Baltimore but it’s probably close,876,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
50,580,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
I guessed 2500 but I'm thinking probably closer to 1750,988,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
1500,58,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
"Yeah, I guessed about 2,340",865,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
I only guessed a few higher...,301,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
at least 2500,1248,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
"My stat was 1,113 events in Baltimore",1934,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
at least 2200,1235,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
"Baltimore is also a high crime city, but definitely smaller than Baltimore.",1468,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
234567,1627,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
I guessed too little I think,1098,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
"My initial guess was 1,850",1934,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
"Sorry, smaller than Chicago.",1468,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
I said 1400,1772,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
2500?,1235,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
"I said 1500, but I think that might not be enough.",1468,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
1800 for me,876,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
i went with 2500,1248,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
It has to be above 2000,335,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
I guessed 2500 also,1134,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
I said 1200 but I think it’s too low,913,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
Now I'm sure is a lot more than what I said,1098,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
"I said 2,000",95,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
I'd like to go well over 2k now that I think about it,1934,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
2500 I guess,1883,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
2100,1627,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
1200 is too low. I stick with 2500,1235,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
There are certain days were there are more than 60 events in chicago,988,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
Chicago dwarfs Baltimore in size,1934,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
probably closer to 4000,1768,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
"Wow, I guessed at just 1220",301,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
4000?,1098,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
I better up my number,301,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
Concensus is closer to 2500,335,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
"Baltimore doesn't have a million people I don't think, Chicago is close to 3",1934,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
"2000 is probably fair, I wouldn't go as high as 3000 or anything",1772,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
322231,1627,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
I'm trying to do mental math...,1468,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
Hmm,1098,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
lol,1235,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
it is gun incidents not just homicide,1768,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
Isn’t Chicago suppose to have super strict gun laws?,876,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
I don't know what to base it on,1883,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
anything do do with guns,1248,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
Yeah homicides are more like 500-600,1772,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
and chicago is notorious for that,1248,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2
I might up my guess to 4500,988,qxej8yHFgwg3hqyNh2

Hello there!,641,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
hi,82,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
Chicago is really bad,198,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
hey,651,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
i put 3000,1074,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
i think 1500,1436,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
Chicago has dozens of shootings each weekend so I would imagine the number is higher than Baltimore,972,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
Hello,280,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
Hi what do you think,1471,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
more than 3 events?,1794,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I said 1000,126,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I figure Chicago would be worse than Baltimore,1054,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
particular in 18,198,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
"hi, my guess was 1700 which I feel may be low",469,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I think it's higher,651,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
Chicago is bad but I heard there are more issues in that area,1332,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
i put 2000,82,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I think 1400,280,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
Chicago is def up there in number,599,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I guessed 2500,641,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I put lower,1332,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
def higher than balt,198,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
They constantly talk about the gun violence in chicago,651,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
2150,708,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
There are very bad areas in Chicago,280,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I said 1450,651,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
ill say 1500 why not,126,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
2500 would be top end for me,1074,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
Chicago has some very bad areas,469,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I said 1300 might go up to 1500,1054,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
"I live near chicago, so I see it on the news all the time",198,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I put 2000 since Chicago is violent,761,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
baltimore and chicago are very similar,1436,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I'm wondering if it's counting police as part of that,886,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
Don't know,1471,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I really don't know,1332,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
so whats the amount were going to all put then?,126,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
they are both bad,1332,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
"I was thinking more along 2000, too but entered lower",469,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I'd say 2500 to 3000,972,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I used to live in Detroit and it's about the same as Chicago I hate to say.,280,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
"Chicago is a larger city than Baltimore, and they are both experiencing major issues with gun violence. I would guess that Chicago has ~50% more incidents than Baltimore, puting it ~1600",899,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
1000 here,1794,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
probably not police,1436,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
i think its around 3500,599,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
1500 is a safe guess,1054,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
"lot of ""imported"" guns here from Indiana or WiS",198,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I bet 1500 is low,198,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
"I agree, Chicago is more violent than Baltimore",280,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
"I think like mid-upper 1000s, but it could def be above 2000",651,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
1000 anything is low,1074,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
2500 seems good based on what everyone is saying,886,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
Although even if multiple people are shot it may be counted as one event,972,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
there is a lot of gang vioence in Chicago,761,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
ill do 2500 lets do it!,126,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
"I agree on the 2500, seems like a good spot",469,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
2500,1074,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
2500,1332,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
"2500, agreed",708,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
2500,1794,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
2500 agreed,641,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
2500,599,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I don't think its over 2500,1436,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
I think the economy has a lot to do with it.  People are broke!,280,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
good job evryone,126,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
NA,435,r4aX3uKoj6sTqTndg1
"Hello, I think its going to be around 1000",950,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
"Hi, I thought it might be a bit higher at 1200, but I'm not sure",1540,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
my guess is 5000,203,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
I'd say 1200,605,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
Hi. I think it's more in Syria,486,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
ill go with 1500,950,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
Syria is more violent I say 3000,1298,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
I think the number is 1250 higher than Somalia,1770,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
"I put 1000 as well, really clueless",1954,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
I guessed 1150,734,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
I estimated 2000,1467,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
I guessed 1500,841,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
"I kind of guessed high, 1,850. But I agree, at least 1000",1268,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
My guess was 400 but I think that is pretty low for the type of problems currently going on there.,146,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
They fight every day,1298,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
lets say 1500,950,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
it could be more than 3000,1590,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
Definitely over 2500,1675,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
"4,000-5,000",203,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
Oh wow I will up my estimate with that in mind,486,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
I don't think it would be more than 200,1770,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
I also could see the number being under reported due to how violent it is there perhaps this reporting agency is not able to track things as easily,1467,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
it more likely higher then lower,1298,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
Syria seems more indiscriminate killing rather than targeted killing.,1448,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
its higher than somalia,950,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
"It's definitely tough to compare, but there's a lot going on in Syria",841,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
Def higher than Somalia. Their population is higher too,1540,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
If it is targeted killing i agree it is lower,1298,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
definitely higher than somalia,1590,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
There have been so many reports of civilians dying in Syria lately,486,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
Yes but not everything is reported,1770,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
I think 1500 is a conservative number,950,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
"Again, ""intentionally targeted""  not sure it would be higher.",1448,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
I believe the answer is 7100,1675,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
They have to target civilians to get them to cooperate,841,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
There have also been suicide bomings that target civilians,486,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
for targeted killing i would say about 1500,1298,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
Maybe 1000 to 1200,1448,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21
7100,1675,RvA4BnjhjrgEPF7b21

Isn't Baltimore higher than Chicago?,1503,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I thought Chicago was much more violent,1353,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I would have to imagine that Chicago is more. I think Chicago led last year,1190,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I chose a number larger than Baltimore because it's a bigger city isn't it?,771,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I dont think so,297,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I believe so,1573,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
Chicago has a high rate of crime,1141,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
Higher how? Chicago definitely has more people.,266,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I think Chicago would be more,2006,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I would think Chicago with a larger population would be higher,721,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
i wasn't sure. all i remember from last year about gun related issues was news about chicago,814,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
"I assumed Chicago has a larger population, thus higher crime rate.",210,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I think it's bigger as well.,154,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
No I think Chicago is one of the highest in the country.,1607,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
it is,721,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
Chicago is pretty bad from what some people who lived there have told me,1573,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I wasn't sure I guessed it was a lot,749,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
Chicago I think,1625,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
Yes it is one of the highest,1141,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
Gun violence is bad in Chicago,297,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I remember hearing that Chicago had a high rate of crime,771,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
So are we settled on Chicago?,1190,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
yes,721,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
How much higher?,154,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
yes,1141,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
yes,1573,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
in 2017 bmore was twice chicago,1503,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
Chicago is the third biggest city in the USA with the highest mrder rate,699,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
So what number did everyone guess?,210,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
What number did y’all choose?,1607,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
How many events would you think?,771,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I bet they're probably fairly close.,130,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
1500,1190,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
about 2000,721,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
2000,210,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
1325,154,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
i went with 2K but i'm pretty sure that's too high,814,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
1700?,771,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
1970,1353,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
2000,1141,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
Yes chicago,1607,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I said  2500,297,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
1500 but i honestly don't know,2006,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
1500,1573,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
2000,1141,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I said 2100<U+0001F923>,1607,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
2000 seems like a good number,749,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I guessed 6000. Chicago has to be like five times bigger than Baltimore.,266,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
The south side had 4000 su,699,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
Maybe I'll change mine to 2000 too,771,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
shottings alone,699,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
its all a guess but at least double,721,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
Chicago is bad.,1607,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
"Lol, hmmmmm",210,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
double at most,1141,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I know the murder rate in Chicago is high but I'm not sure just how much of that is guns,1353,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I know one of the highest if not the highest in the US,1607,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
The south side had more than Boltimore alone,699,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
Just not sure of the number.,1607,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
ANyone changing their guess alot?,154,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
most of it is gun violence,1141,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
nope,721,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
Nope,1190,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
it should be worese than maryland,504,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
It is the highest in the USA,699,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
Not really,771,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
no,1141,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
no,1353,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
NA,874,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW1
I put 6000,740,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
I feel like there will be even more in 2018.,404,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
Oh I only put 1500,404,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
I put 9882,1524,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
I put 3000,195,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
I must be really low,384,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
I said 1500,384,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
I just doubled it because Chicago is more violent than Baltimore,1257,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
Chicago is suuuper violet,1524,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
I put 562,1598,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
"Chicago is the worst of the worst for that sort of thing, right? But, how much worse could it possibly be?",1661,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
I am thinking its in the thousands,1875,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
Chicago is more violent than baltimore,54,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
1800 Baltimore is real bad but Chicago is surely worse,1407,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
2200. I was on the low side too.,1297,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
I put 400,1279,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
"3000, i think chicago had more gun violence",905,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
Same,1515,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
I also believe there was more in CHicago but also only put 1500,2021,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
4500,1875,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
How much bigger population wise is Chicago?,1297,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
Chicago is supposed to be the worst in the U.S. for this.,195,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
"i put 1700, but chicago is like 5 times the size of baltimore, so im thinking it is closer to 6000",448,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
"I don't know exactly how much bigger, but considerably bigger pop",1524,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
Maybe 3000,384,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
"Chicago is probably over 2000, I may be low at 1800",1407,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
"Chicago has what, 7 million",1875,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
Yeah it is pretty bad there. The one thing we can agree on is that it is more than 1113 lol,404,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
"I said 3000, although I may have been lowballing that a bit",195,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
I thought about going higher so maybe closer to 2500,2021,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
"its like 650,000 people in baltimore to 2,800,000 people in chicago",448,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
population,448,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
metro area population?,905,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
awesome info,1297,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
gun violence is likely around the same im thinking,448,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
Gun violence in Chicago is bad due to all of the gangs,1279,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
def in the thousands for gun,1875,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
oh with that population maybe even closer to 3500,2021,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
6000 may be a low ball,740,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
wow you think 6000 is low balling it,2021,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
"baltimore is bad as well in terms of violence, chicago is just much larger n terms of population and thus gets more coverage",448,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
Maybe its lower because not all is reported?,1875,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
I may have been low with only putting 400. I was thinking more in the line of deaths,1279,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
its probably 5000-57500,448,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
So 4000?,1515,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
*5700,448,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
I am going to say 4500,1875,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
I put 400 but I was thinking deaths also,1107,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2
4500 is reasonable,448,SyKkcGGLmEdtg6piW2

Hello,869,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I just took a guess,979,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Hi,979,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Hi,34,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I was guessing less than 4000,1508,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
helo,277,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
does that include books?,489,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Hi,547,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
ok,1262,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
5000 here,1991,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I guessed 1/3,997,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
5000 here,309,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
5400,277,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1

5000,926,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Do you understand what we are doing?lol,1828,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Im in college and no it doesn't include book,472,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
3000,1552,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
"I guessed 4,000 but don't really have a reason",433,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I just guessed under 4000,1551,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
books,472,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I guessed 5.000,34,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I said 1000 lol,979,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
"I just guessed. I figured it was a little more than half of tuition went toward paying for education costs va dorms, food, etc",1255,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
interesting nicknames though ;lol,1991,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Overthought it because I'm an instructor. Put 4500,254,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I guess 3000,869,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I guess 10,1262,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I guessed 3000,547,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
i figured half too,277,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
3200,997,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
haha,979,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I assumed a little less than half,433,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I said 6000,1255,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
i think its somewhere between 2000-3000,472,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
5000 seemed like a fair guess to me,926,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
hi,1262,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
yeah because it is never the amount they said,1991,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I would say half as well,869,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
3.5,1262,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Less than half,997,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
5000 sounds good,277,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
half sounds about right to me,1551,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Definitely less than half,254,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
ok,1262,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
i thought much less than half.,1508,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I said 3500,489,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Half seems fair and it just made sense,34,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Yeah figured safe at half but probably less,309,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
so we all were in the same ballpark,926,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
no,1262,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
yes,1262,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
you have to remember these institutions are greedy and don't necessarily care about putting more money into the education side of things.,472,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
'Exactly,979,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Right,997,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
yes,1262,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
id say we all were pretty close to similar opinion,1991,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Between like 40 to 60% of the total,433,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Do we all have to agree on the same answer?,869,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
TRUE,1551,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Yes,997,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
who here is in college now,926,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
education is severely undervalued,1991,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
yes,277,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
alot of that money is used for administrative costs,547,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
i am,472,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
but in India  cost very high,1262,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
they even have to buy supplies for students...,1991,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I went in the middle ages!,997,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
Administration makes about 400% of prof salary so the actual pay to instructors is crazy low,254,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
I suppose it depends on if they added another fountain to the school that year,309,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
"3,000",472,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1
not to mention all the tests teachers need for their educational qualifications,1991,tpbXWiAmmpN2nu3vk1

hello,436,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
good afternnon :),459,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
I wasn't really sure so I just guessed 40%. How about you?,1326,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
135 million,1901,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
20 million,459,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
hello,331,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
I figured around 50 million.,302,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
I said 100 million,1304,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
2,818,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
Oof. I seem high.,1326,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
i went with 30 million - it's three huge hubs,1241,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
295 million was my guess,1441,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
New york is biggest airport.  I think 50 million,436,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
i stated 4.5 its a big hub,766,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
50 milyon,1066,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
"I think I put it at 150, I figured due to a lot of international flights and whatnot but am not sure",299,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
I am thinking roud 95M as JFK is a large hyb,251,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
100 million,1666,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
i think i went way to high,1434,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
"Well, keep in mind that it would be hard for a single airport to have a million people pass though",1665,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
"It's a huge airport, though.",302,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
there are a lot of people coming and going from these major hubs,459,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
"Yeah, me too. 40% is 276. ><",1326,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
ok so it looks like I was way off,1441,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
I've been.,302,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
definitely around 50 million,436,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
I wonder what it is,459,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
"Well, I am going to go up from 3 million ... perhaps to 10 million",1665,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
yeah I was way off as well,705,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
I feel it's at least 50 million.,302,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
"I assumed a lot of international flights would go in and out of there, but... maybe not, or maybe I just way overestimated.",1326,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
do we get to find out,1441,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
Not sure.,302,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
I don't think they told me last time.,1326,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
its 3 airports all together,766,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
Maybe 90 m them,1066,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
I think I have done one of these before and I dont remember getting the correct answer,705,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
I think I said 200 million not 20 million,459,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
google,818,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
trying to find some statistics on it,299,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
Considering the size of all 3 airports they probably account for almost 1/3 of the total,251,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
would love to know,459,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
me too,1434,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
Ive been there many times - its huge,436,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
will they tell us?,459,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
Probably not.,302,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1
Don't think so. :(,1326,u5bfvJrCqzaKLwHho1

"Hey, what do you all think?",1633,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
I say 85 Million,1942,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
Hi,1577,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
Hey ok,1502,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
How about 5?,1633,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
I think 10 million.,1518,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
close to 100 I would think,1740,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
51 millions,481,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
I guessed 50,1238,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
Hey,1518,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
85 million itis,1502,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
I was way higher,1165,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
I went with 35,616,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
I said 15 million,1017,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
20 million,196,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
Maybe only 4. There are a lot of airports in the world.,1633,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
100+,1577,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
375 i guessed quickly cause time almost up,1175,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
Its 3 airports and biggest city in america.,1942,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
just in usa or international too i wonder,204,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
I guessed 175 - those are all very large airports,1165,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
375 is too high for sure. That's half of all air traffic,616,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
ATL is a bigger one than NY i think,1740,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
But nyc is a huge international airport.   Anyone travel there recently?,1017,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
"I went around 150. There are a lot of airports in the US, but those are all hugr",1385,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
"It's global, pretty sure.",1165,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
"Very popular airport, and port of entry to US - I'm guessing around 100 million",1315,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
Its gotta be pretty big. Newark is a huge hub,1652,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
100 sound reasonable too,1909,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
Passengers doesn't mean just residents,1577,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
I said 145,1269,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
probably new york city area is the one with more boarding traffic,481,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
100 sounds like a reasonable answer.,1017,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
I'm real lmao,1165,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
real here,481,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1

It's robots here?,1577,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
"Yes, but think of all the airports around the world. In Europe. Even all the huge U.S. cities. South America. Eastern Asia. Australia. India.",1633,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
Lmbo,1909,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
Real,1269,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
Real but good question,1017,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
bot lol,204,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
I think around 100 is prob the safe bet,1740,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
I think 4 is reasonable.,1633,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
Sticking with 85 million,1942,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
So at least double it for JFK + Laguardia,616,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
So between 100 to 150,1269,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
thats what i said about 50 million each,481,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
So maybe thats increased since 2016,1740,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
100 sounds safe,1175,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
we just have to get as close as possible?,1165,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
yes,481,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
It's not price is right style and we can't go over?,1165,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1
45-50,1740,uK7iXPQSbsPNRygiB1

i am confident in my answer,587,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
I said 3 million but that seems low,2012,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
Hello. Any art lovers here?,747,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
to be honest i am not an art person but i have no clue,890,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
I think 3 mil and change is good,1422,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
I also said 3 million,80,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
art enthusiasts love early works,569,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
I went with 5 million,474,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
i said more like 20 million,587,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
i said 1.2,569,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1

no clue either but said 1.5 million.   Seems now that this is out of range,940,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
4.3,754,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
I said 3 million,1761,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1

dang I said 18 million...,106,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
have no idea just put 1.5,615,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
"This was back in 2018 when the art market was slightly softer, plus this is not the greatest piece by Van Gogh.",1422,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
you can change answer,474,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
no clue ...,754,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
not a typical van gogh,569,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
"but i really do not know, just had to guess",1539,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
I think it is in the 3 million ballpark range as a result,1422,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
2.5 ?,879,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
anything by van gogh will go for a lot of money,587,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
even a drawing like this,587,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
looks like one of his painting sold for 450 millio,890,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
"Does not matter, people like aesthetics too",1422,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
i feel like its closer to 7-12,569,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
TRUE,1761,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
anyone know the name of this one?,80,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
Can we do outside research?,1422,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
consensus ?,879,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
i'm sure it's more than 3 mil now that I really think about it,747,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
i would thikn it would be in the hundred millions,890,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
"now I say double digits, maybe 20 million",747,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
"It is just a drawing, charcoal on paper, not a big painting",1422,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
That plays into it too,1422,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
its not double digits,1015,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
so now I say 33 mil,747,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
I dont think it said anything about not researching,1761,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
the size and charcoal paper was why I said 1.5 million,940,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1
I think i'm gonna stick with 3,80,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx1

I said 1 mil,411,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
1 million total guess by me,729,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
I said 1 million as well,2030,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
my guess was too high,1299,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
"I put 2 cause it's a Van Gogh but it's just a charcoal drawing, I don't think it'd be worth as much as his oil paintings",1862,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
Said 3 but have no idea about art,753,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
Lots of 1 and 3,1876,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
is anyone familiar with art prices,994,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
No idea about art.,411,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
seems like we are closer to the single digits in millions,729,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
"I think sketches tend to sell, but even a famous name doesn't make it that expensive",1085,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
I said 4.  But it was just a guess,1679,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
prices are outlandish,1299,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
no idea,1044,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
I think I may change my answer to 1.5,994,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
i think 2.5 is good,24,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
Yeah 2 or 2.5. That way we meet in the middle.,753,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
it is a good point that it is charcoal,994,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
more than one million,1299,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
I will say 2,1044,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
so maybe everyone should say 2,994,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
ok i will change it to 2,411,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
"Yeah, 2 sounds good.",753,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
I agree,2030,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
is everyone in agreement,994,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
2 is good,330,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
"its small, but from one of the most significant artists of all time, so I think the price is definitely in the millions",701,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
sounds great to me,994,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
It is small. IDK though. People pay a lot!,849,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
2 sounds good,1679,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
yes,1044,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
I agree 2,411,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
I think two is a good neighborhood,729,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
ok 2 it is,994,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
is it better if we all guess the same?,701,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
I am not sure,1876,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
According to Sotheby's his sketches tend to go from half a million to about 2,1085,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
I thought that's why we were discussing it right?,753,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
maybe???,994,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
I am sticking with my original 1.3 personally,701,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
so lets say about 2?,729,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
2 sounds good,1876,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
seems like we are closer to 2 or 3 than 1 now,729,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2
"yes, 2",994,uQF55wf6Psh7htnjx2

Hi,1657,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
how much did you say?,1479,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
what did you guys say?,1452,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
WHat do you guys think?,224,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Hi,1169,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Hi,488,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
5000,2001,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I said 2000,400,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I said 1500,663,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
"5,000",1657,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
"5,000 -- no basic for this tho",451,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
5000,1788,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
i saod 5000,1452,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
5000,259,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
7000,768,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
*basis,451,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
3000,2027,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
"i said 7500, but I think that was high",1773,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I think it's lower,224,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
5000,1840,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
i said around 1400,772,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I said 5000 as well,1479,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
2500,1620,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Is said 5000,488,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
wow rob why so high?,1479,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
15000,1857,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
5000,702,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
9000,1169,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
"I think it's lower, too",1657,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
is 5000 erasonable?,1452,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Money is probably spend on everything but actual instruction.,224,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
"Intersting, higher",1657,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Professors aren't paid much.,400,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I said 5000 but it could be less,259,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Depends on the colleges,1857,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I think most of it goes to the school itself,1479,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
i think most is spent elsewhere,772,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
sports probably,1452,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
It could,1857,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Go high,1857,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
5000 sounds reasonable,1788,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
"I think it's still 3000, and most is spent elsewhere.",2027,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
"agreed, i think a lot is spend on the school's operations (maintaining the grounds, etc.)",451,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
"Like...it's how much teachers are paid, right?",1657,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I think it's below 1000 even,224,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
5000 too high I think,1620,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
"Too many variables for a good answer, but less than half seems reasonable to me.",2001,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
so we can assume it's below 5000,768,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Maybe 4000,259,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
So do we think it’s higher or lower than 5000?,488,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I am going with 15000,1857,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
"Per student is not per class, so teacher's salary has not much to do with it.",224,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
i still think lower,772,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Lower,259,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I hardly think teachers see a lot of it because thats why they say that teaching is one of the hardest jobs. it's stressful. maybe not so much at the college level but there doesn't seem to be much money in it,1479,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Definitely lower than 5000,400,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I like 4000,2001,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I think it's lower than 5000,1840,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
so letss go with 4000?,1452,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
"Maybe 4000, I agree",2027,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
4000 is a safer guess,1840,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
4000 sounds about right,1479,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
It could be more than the  revenue. Tuition does not cover student expenses,1169,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I'm thinking 2000 max,400,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
i'm thinking like 4000,1773,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
5000,702,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
"I mean, what other benefit do you really see as a student, besides what the teacher is earning...?",1657,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Maybe 3000,1620,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I think what percentage of 10 would go to professor salaries,663,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Not sure what college have such low cost as 4000,1857,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
10K,663,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
3500 max I think.,2027,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
per student though,1452,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Very little goes to instruction,224,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
"I'm gonna go loer, like 3500, yeah",1657,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Yeah.,2027,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Less than 10%,224,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
State college Tyrion is 12k average,1857,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I think i'm going to stay with 5000,1788,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
so maybe even zero hahahh,1452,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
I agree. especially since some of these teachers are adjuncts,1479,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
they don't see alot,1479,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Still seems too high,400,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
3000?,1452,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW1
Hi,1373,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
hello,1115,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Hello,1748,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Hey,248,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Hi,94,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
hello,1824,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
hi everyone,1586,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Hi,1591,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
hello,1466,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Hi,513,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Hello Hello,275,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
hi,775,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
hi,1812,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Hi,1454,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
What do we think?,248,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
hello,1009,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I think 6500,513,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
$2k,1454,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
How come 6500?,1373,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
"hi, does anyone have an informed guess?",104,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
so what was everyone's answer. I said 3000. Just a guess,1586,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
a smoove 3000,1877,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I was thinking around 7000,275,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I guessed 4000,1009,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
i thought around 3000 too,1115,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
i was 7000 as well,104,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
"I figured with admin costs, etc....$7,000",1466,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I said $1500 just a guess,1373,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
3500?,1824,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I said $1500.  Most of college expenses aren't instruction related.,1812,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I was thinking a lot about all the other expenditures universities have,1586,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
complete guess,1009,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Mine was a bit less than 3000 for the cost of living,1748,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
"Professor salaries are pretty decent, facilities",513,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
"Lots of staff, athletics, etc",1586,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
vs the entire thing,1748,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I think after costs about 3000,248,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I expect the number to be on the low side. $800.,1101,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I figure they professors demand a lot and so does the maintenance of facilities,1454,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
"i was also at 1500, guessing",775,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
"I think as much was spent as was made, around 10000",538,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
It said specifically instruction,1586,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
3000,1591,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
oh ok,1748,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
So that would be professors salaries and what else?,1586,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
it is going to be low,104,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I’m good with 1500,1454,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I was thinking around 1500,94,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
like 15%,104,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
over 9000,1877,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
classroom up keep,513,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
"Depends on where you live, here professors make 6 figures when they are there tenured.",275,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Professors are generally not paid well,1101,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
so im with 1500 as well,104,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Yes just going by instruction thats paying salaries the rest goes to college,1115,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
some are if they research,513,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
"Faculty, staff payments. Programs, supplies",248,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
good point maybe 3000,1466,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Yeah 1500 is probably the best guess. Adjunct profs (i.e. most of them) get paid VERY poorly,1586,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I see I see,275,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I agree it depends where you live,1009,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Let’s call it at 1500,1454,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
loooool,1877,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I agree with 1500,1586,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
"Yes, $1500 is the best guess",1373,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
"They spend a lot, but they make a lot in revenue for sports, alumni donations etc",1591,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
ok. 1500 sounds right then,1748,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
"1500, i agree",104,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Going with 1500,94,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Sure,275,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Nice.,1454,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
I wasn't sure how it breaks down before,1748,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Sounds good.,1586,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
1500 sounds good,1115,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Thanks,1748,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
1500 or less.,1101,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Yay team.,1586,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Haha,1748,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Thanks all,1373,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
1500 is probably high,1101,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
Good job everyone,1454,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
NA,1042,v2xvu5LADSaiAprwW2
What do you guys think?,382,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
My first guess. What that.  A guess,1797,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
500,194,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
"We have no data for Yemen, correct?",239,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
i have no clue. probably a lot more,610,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
A whole  lot of times,1378,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
Yemen would have more right?,745,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
Checking page,1378,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
I think it will be more than Somalia.,382,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
Mine too. I have no idea how Yemen compares to Somalia.,2032,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
There's a lot of conflict there I estimate 1000,1756,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
Correct. Just Somalia,1797,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
I said 1.000,365,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
I guessed 300,2020,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
Hi,2022,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
no idea,36,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
i said only 20,540,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
I went with 1000,745,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
I guessed 2500/,382,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
No idea,402,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
I think it's worse in Yemen.,365,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
I said 1200,711,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
my guess 600,1285,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
"91,000 over the past four and a half years.",1378,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
whats the final answer then?,540,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
Definitely worse in Yemen,1756,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
Definately more than somalia.,382,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
I'm voting on the lower end- lol,540,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
1000 then is my second guess,1797,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
But are they being reported?,745,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
change that to about 20000,1756,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
1000 agreed?,540,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
I am not sure,2020,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
Just in 2018? Wow.,2032,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
"Nah, it will be around 2500",382,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
okay then 10000?,540,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
"it wants number of events, not fatalities",167,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
That’s fatalities tho. Not event number,1797,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
since 2015 so divide that by 4,1378,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
does each event equal a fatalitie?,745,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
"That's a shame, if that is true.",365,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
i'd guess about 2500 to 3000,610,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
"Yeah, so around 2500",382,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
there are 12 months out of the year guys?,540,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
Sounds good,194,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
"Oh my, that is  a lot",2020,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
yemen 2018,540,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
"for events probably about 3000, not counting individual fatalities",1756,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
"30 seconds left, so lets stick to 2500 guys",382,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
i'd better cancel my vaction to yemen next week. i say 2500,610,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
Okay,2032,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
2500,745,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
lol,803,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
2500,1756,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
2500 it is then,382,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
2500,2032,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
NA,716,vfRyQ63uELBptDgB91
"Hey guys! I guessed 1,100",1614,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I just guessed wildly because I have zero clue about this.,1497,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I think it would be higher for Syria,1092,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I also guessed 1000,532,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I was thinking around 1000,1051,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I said 1100 as well,1092,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I guessed 3200,1757,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
Hi!! I said 1250,1147,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
"Hey! I guess 800, I really have no idea",183,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
"Yeah, we're talking about the 2 most f'ed up countries on the planet at the moment, so Syria is probably similar",1331,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
Wow guess that was low lol,183,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
i guessed 953,591,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I guessed 900,1331,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I GUESSED OVER 10000,1321,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
It is probably close to the same as Somalia,1080,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I went with 3000,667,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
10000 is much too high,1331,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I only guessed cause i am not sure on this i said 750,527,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
they are both in civil wars,591,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
Yeah no idea as well. Just 1000 seemed possible,532,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
"I guessed 2000, because I also feel Syria would have more such events.",842,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I am sticking with 1100,1092,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
now i think so too,1321,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
"More resources in Syria, though",1331,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
maybe closer to 1000,1331,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
around 1000,1804,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
"Im thinking 1,300",1996,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I said 500 because I didn't have any clue,1497,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
Both countries are in turmoil,1092,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I guessed 900,1331,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I’m revising and guessing 5500,1757,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I missed your initial answer,532,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
definitely war torn,591,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
oh ok,532,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
Think about how many per day it would be to be over 1000,1092,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
"Agree, both countries are in turmoil.  I hear more about Syria, so I think I will stay with the 2000.",842,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I'm guessing higher than Somalia now,1080,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I think over 3000 seemed too high,532,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
Has to be around 1100,1051,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
2500?,1321,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I also feel they would have more given all the conflict over there.,1996,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I think 1100-1200 is probably most accurate,1147,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
Why around 1100?,532,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
Just a wild guess,1051,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
"I found a number online that said 2254 but I""m not sure if that is correct",1614,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
Assad is a beast and kills anyone,1757,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I may change to 1000,527,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
i will go with 2300,1321,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
"alright, well best of luck to everyone",1092,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
I'm upping to like 1100,1331,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
2250 may be correct,842,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
so which one 1100 or 2200?,532,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1
good luck,1321,vXBkyrryzAX9hbHeP1

"I have no idea, I put 2 million",2005,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
Not really,385,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I just suspect they are priceless,1905,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I think it sold for over a million,871,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I'm thinking since it's a drawing and not a famous painting of his it would be under 10,1537,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
"I guessed 20 million, but I think that's low",574,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I have no idea how art is priced. I went with 7.5,594,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
"I have no idea, but I can't believe it would be under 3 milion",1621,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
"Hi, I put 1.2 million... since he is a very famous painter",2031,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I put 1.2,871,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
i put 0.5,774,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
"Same, I put 2 million",1483,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
This is priceless!,574,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I went with 5 million,1752,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I put 25 but i just guessed,689,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
Hi I put 2.5 but don’t have a clue,413,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I went with 1.3,385,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
i guessed 5,1057,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
What was everyone’s answer?,1476,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
3.5 million,453,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I guessed 10 million but I really don't know at all,272,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
1.5 million,891,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
"I guessed 3 million, but that might be low now that I think about it",1621,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
SOme paintings of his have gone for over 50 million,574,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
Think 10 too high,453,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
Under five sounds reasonable,1537,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
50 million sounds really high,1621,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
"I agree, it is priceless. I put 1.2 million, though that might have been a little low",871,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
just a charcol sketch,453,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I went with 1 million.,1476,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
2 million,2005,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
"I couldn't decide so quickly, but I bet it actually is worth more than the 2 million.",1483,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
"It is high, but this is considered one of the greatest painters of all time",574,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I put 8 but that was a shot in the dark,1905,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
the medium does make a difference,385,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
"Yeah, it’s not like one of his famous paintings",413,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
"It's not one of his really famous ones, so probably not 50 million or something",272,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
but I'll give you $5. Best I can do,1905,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
It also doesn't seem very bit.. 18 inches?,1621,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I'm still going mich highter,574,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I was thinking charcoal might make it more valuable. If there are less of those than his regular oil paintings,689,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
big i meant,1621,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
"Let me get a buddy, he knows all about these things",871,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I think im going to shoot lower,594,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I'm still going at least 35 million,574,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I thhink ill move it to about 5,594,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
That's true it's probably quite fragile compared to oil paintings? I don't really know!,272,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
People are crazy for art these days,574,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
"It is small, I think under 10",453,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I'm going to say atleast 8-10 mil,1483,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
"Ten million seems good, it is not as well known as some of his other works",2031,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
Yeah I guess I'll stick with my 10 million guess?,272,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
Im thinking 1-1.5 million,871,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I might change my guess to 5,1621,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I'm going with 5. I agree about the medium making it more valuble,1537,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
I still think 5 to 10 at most,453,waPZC72RxqETD2tM61
Uhm I put 10 million Hahahah,1723,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
It has to be in the millions. I guessed 12 million.,1912,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1

"I put in the hundred thousand range, figures the million was a suggestion to skew answers",1030,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
can we just google it?,782,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
I thought I remembvered that it was less than a million.,409,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
two and a half million,1200,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
i know that painting values are determined by a small group of people,782,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
No lol,2037,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
googling is a good idea,1030,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
I don't think we are supposed to look it up lol,1912,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
I think it could be more than a few million,1915,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
I don't think so,1171,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
Picasso's usually go for multi millions though,1912,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
Did someone google,1723,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
Ohhh,2037,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
I think it’ll be in the millions too.. it’s Picasso,1414,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
multi million at least,1200,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
After listening to you guys I'm going way up,1776,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
I think I guessed too low.,409,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
i put 2 million but with more thinking i think it's a lot higher,707,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
Pee is stored in the balls. I'm gonna guess higher too,2037,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
I need to come down a little but lol,1414,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
maybe I'm too low too,1200,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
"I guessed 24 million, but I think it could be more",1915,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
some sold over 100 million,782,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
some only 50 million,782,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
It's looking like the average is around 10 million,460,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
Wow,2037,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
wow,1200,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
I hope they tell us.,409,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1

10 million sounds good,249,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1
sold one in march 2018 for 115 million,782,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g1

What do you think,624,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I guessed 1.5 what did you all guess?,1086,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I said $15 million.,1516,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I said 2.2,875,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
1.5,1721,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
i'd say anywhere from 5 to 15 mil,1771,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
"I said 3, but total guess obviously",199,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I guessed 14,624,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I put 17. That's a human sized Picasso,677,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
"i guess 10,000",1457,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
Honestly I had no idea,1086,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
"i said 3, but i have no idea",980,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I guessed 2,228,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I think I've heard his paintings selling for 50 to 100 mil,1806,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I guessed 5.5,417,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I guessed 250 mi and think I was to high,281,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I thinks its alot.higher like 100,624,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
No idea- guessed 7,1455,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I guessed 50 actually.,679,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
Wide range here!,1516,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
"its like worth so obviously 15,000",1457,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
25 mil,1333,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
art is hard to guess,417,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
"Wow, maybe 20 mil?",1086,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
Why not closer to $10-30mm,1805,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I don't recognize that work so probably not so much as othes,1721,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
Yes.,1516,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
looked online quick and I see value 25-35 m,281,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
Maybe 15?,228,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
Picasso painting heavy demand,624,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
yes that's correct,1457,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
"picasso is one of the most famous, only museums and obscenely wealthy will have them",1806,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
25m works for me,980,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
picasso art is very famous,1457,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I think probably 150,624,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
"Picasso is so famous though, it has to be high.",679,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
25 works for me too,677,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
Yeah 25 sounds good,875,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I think 25 m,281,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
"picasso put out a ton of work, could be a wide range",269,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
definitely below 100 mil,417,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
"so it may worth above 10,000",1457,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I think 50 would be the minimum,1806,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
"hmm 25 m, not 30?",1086,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
Art auctions not my game,1455,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
Ok,228,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
29 mil,1333,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
i'd say 30 mill,1771,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
Yep 25 is probably reasonable.,1516,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
150 mil is what im going with,624,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I think higher too,172,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
ok 30,677,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
30,228,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
30,281,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
169 I think was the most,1806,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
1.9,1721,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
where are these numbers coming from,1805,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
still a pretty wide range,1086,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
We're guessing.,1516,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
its 51 inch wide,1457,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
"I am, at least.",1516,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
29.6 at sale in 2018,281,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
yup,980,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
it's rather large-does size matter?,1455,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
me too,1721,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
and 64 ich tall,1457,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
artist here with degree in art history. i say 30 is good,677,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
Thats huge,624,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
so its big quiet,1457,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
i don't think size matters,281,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
30,228,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
I think 30,1086,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
2.5,1721,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
If its picassos it does,624,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
yes you are correct,1457,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
Maybe more expensive larger,1805,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
its human sized canvas,677,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
i'll go with 30,980,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
yes its picasso,1457,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
30 it is,417,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2
39,1805,weCbkYxBDT79kd83g2

hey,303,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
what are your estimate?,931,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
"Yeah, I guessed 850?",848,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
Hi,603,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
Went with 650.  Less than Baltimore.,179,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
yes I believe Philly has less,914,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
wendy you are correct,584,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I guessed 800,573,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
Is Philly bigger though,1677,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I think maybe 900,1830,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
i guessed 1000,914,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
i guessed 1200,1336,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
600,171,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
around 800,111,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
"me, 1900",931,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I guessed 2500 since its a larger city.,1420,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
also guessed 1000,1211,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I guess 1750 because Philly is bigger.,476,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I guessed 900,584,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I went with higher and 2002,495,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I guessed 900,303,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
OH that's a good point..,848,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
Baltimore is way more violent,914,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
feel comes less than baltimore,838,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I am POSITIVE it is lower than Baltimore,584,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
Philadelphia is a crime city,931,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
did baltimore have the most events or percentage wise?  I was almost sure it had the most total,573,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
not like Baltimore,914,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I think Philly might be somewhat safe,1830,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
As far as I know Philly crime rate is not significant different from Baltimore,603,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I grew up in baltimore and know it is very violent,303,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I disagree. It's higher in Phillis,931,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
Philly is more safe,914,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I thought a little more due to pop difference,1677,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I agree Baltimore may be more violent; but Philly is still bigger. It's about the population size.,476,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
It might be almost even if you consider the population size,848,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
any one from philadelphia.. What about crime rate there?,838,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I've been in Philly before.,931,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I am from Jersey,914,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
It might be lower,495,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I feel pretty good with my 900 rating,1830,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I'm near philly,584,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
i am from texas so have no idea.,573,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I'm from Jersey too,1830,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
900 seems low to me,1336,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
the burbs seem to be dangerous.,931,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
Dies,603,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I am confident with less than Baltimore by far,914,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
YEp,914,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
Maybe 950?,848,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
1000,838,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
i think 900 might be right.  maybe 1000 - definitely less than baltimore,573,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
what do you thing Eigo,1830,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
the burbs not the actual city,914,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
im also jersey,495,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
Hi Turtle,1830,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I still is more than Baltimore,931,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
I'm still going with a little more,1677,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
gonna go with something between 800 and 900,495,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
Baltimore is a very economically depresswed city,303,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
Same,1420,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1
Going with less still.,179,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ1

3000 ?,634,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
hi,1052,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I estimated 2000,1980,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
2000?,1911,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
i said 1500,412,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I guessed 1500.  No idea though,1820,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
1500,577,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Hi,2018,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
i said 1500 as well,928,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I said 999,2018,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I thought 800,925,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I would say like 1000,17,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
2150,213,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I put 1980,1619,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Thought maybe half. Baltimore is super violent.,1866,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
1800,1052,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I thought more...1500 is what I said too,209,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
2200,290,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I went 2400,1364,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
is Philadelphia more violent than Baltimore?,577,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Now I think I'm low,1866,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I think Baltimore is more violent that most people think.,1911,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
"i live in philly, we have some pretty bad areas, but i wouldnt say that much worse than baltimore",412,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Baltimore is more violent but Phila is much larger,1820,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Philly is larger and pretty violent,1364,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Baltimore is larger on gun violence than phila,925,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
1200,428,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
"yah, baltimore is pretty bad. I don't think Philly have more gun related violence",17,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
1500?,1911,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
though*,17,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Philly is violent too- I think bigger than Baltimore,209,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I though 2000 but Philadelphian seems less dangerous than Baltimore so maybe it's less,1980,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I thought Baltimore was worse,1866,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
So maybe 1500?,634,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Baltimore is more violent imho,577,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Baltimore is worse I believe,2018,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
i vote philly is more violent,928,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
800,925,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
but I don't know anything about Philly or Baltimore,577,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Philly is larger I think,634,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
1450,213,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Per capita Baltimore is worse,1364,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Phila is like twice as large a city,1820,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Hmmm,1866,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
1450 is a good guess,1911,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I have no idea,1052,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I checked GVA's website. There were about 500 events in Philly in 2018.,1135,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
lol,412,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I am going with a higher number for Philadelphia,209,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I live near philly..,17,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
500 only?,634,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Lol okay 500?,1980,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
500 i guess,412,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Philly is less gun violent,925,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
That's close to my initial guess.,1866,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
and dark knight also live in philly as well..,17,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
Really 500?,209,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
500 works,1052,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
m kay,213,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I say 800,925,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
damn only 500??,928,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
650,213,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
do we get a bonus the closer we get to real estimate?,577,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
I think it more than 500,17,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2
750-800?,17,Wg9QjKYeJBEvfbYdQ2

hi,1574,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
hello,1435,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
What did everyone guess?,1684,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
I came up with 80,1118,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
I guessed 100,53,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
i guessed 45,857,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
hi,660,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
I said 350 Million,1684,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
"I assume they meant 690MM passengers worldwide, so I just naively guessed 1% from New York -- 7MM",1600,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
"132, but think thats high",496,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
35-,1435,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
(and Hello),1600,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
85,1955,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
I did 18,1574,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
350,1435,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
35,660,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
Hi - I guess 3 million but am thinking it is way too low,1870,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
i said 345,354,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
4,1112,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
i guessed 280 and i think that's probably high,1648,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
seems a bit low now that I say it out loud,1600,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
i did 15,1226,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
I feel like this willbe a high number,1684,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
"I was guessing around 1/4 of worldwide flights in the US, and about 10% of those the NYC area",1574,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
I didn't understand the question. 1 million seems like alot.,1280,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
what does everyone think in percentage terms?,1600,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
I think I should have divided the 350 by 2 again,1435,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
JKF is extremly busyso I would say about 1/4 of the flights come from there,1684,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
i think maybe a quarter of the total,1648,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
so like 150?,1790,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
I think about 110,496,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
150,1955,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
thats what i was thinking,1118,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
440,1280,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
"London, Dubai, Singapore are all extremely busy as well, though, so I think 25% is much too high",1600,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
I agree,788,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
I think 350 is too obvious,1435,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
130?,1790,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
"690 million is worldwide and although a lot fly into and out of New York, that is just one portion.",1870,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
300,354,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
70?,1648,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
"10% on the other hand, might be reasonable...",1600,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
150,1955,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
I was basing it on the US being 25% of carbon emissions  ::embarrassed::,1574,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
150,1401,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
207,354,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
20% of all flights would be 138,1790,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
69,788,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
I hate math so I have no clue I just went with my gut,1684,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
Im stickwith 150,1955,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
10% would be 69mil 20 woudl be 138,1600,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1
Think we're in the ballpark between 120-140,496,WMZM4RFCkDLifFsNn1

Do you feel if Somalia is more violent or less violent than Yemen?,1728,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
"Good afternoon, Any ideas,",662,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
More?,696,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
More,1943,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
I feel Yemen,1413,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
Slightly less.,1692,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
I would say more? But i'm not confident,794,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
less?,662,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
Not a chance,1481,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
I just made a guess,1871,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
About the same,764,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
I think it is more,959,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
to me more in Yemen,1413,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
"I'd say more, but I have no clue",877,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
"Yemen has been a hotbed compared to Somalia lately, IMO, so more than Somalia",1397,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
"I guessed too, I'm saying less but slightly less",662,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
More,682,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
What did everyone guess? We have to agree on a group answer,1728,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
Somalia has the pirates on the coast,662,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
May be about 100,1871,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
1500,1397,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
more,1481,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
I feel Yemen is more but Somalia has its share of violence as well.,1208,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
Yemen is repeatedly bombed by the Saudi Government,1692,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
"I put 50 because I noticed that 841 happened in Yemen for 2018 and I rounded up in my estimate, to the next nearest tenth.",781,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
Yemen ask more violent cases than somalia,959,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
I put six hundred something,696,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
i guess it to be 1500,1413,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
"Sorry, I meant 850",781,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
Can’t decide the numbers,682,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
I guessed 620,662,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
I feel Yemen has more violence.,1216,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
on civilians,662,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
right on,1481,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
Ok,781,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
What can be the actual answer?,1871,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
"So if Yemen has more violence, at least 850?",794,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
I think Yemen is quite a bit more violent but how much is intentional targeting vs. incidental?,2034,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
Yes I do agree Yemen hasn’t more violence,959,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
Would everyone agree to say 1000 as an average between all our answers?,1728,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
No,696,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
Yes,781,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
Above 1000,1413,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
750?,662,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
I'm fine with 1000,877,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
That's too much,764,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
It can be based on the people reporting it,682,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
1000,485,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
I guess it is 900,959,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
I’m good with 1000,1943,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
"At least a 1,000",1216,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
750,1871,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
750,696,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
"Yeah, 1000 then",794,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
900,959,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
I'd go with the 1000 ball park. One has more internal violence while the other is engaged in a military conflict which also is causing significant civilian deaths.,1692,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
Let's see,1871,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
Fifteen seconds,1728,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
1000 ?,1728,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
1000 or more but not less than it,682,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
going with 1250,1397,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1
good luck all,662,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS1

1050?,429,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
I think it is less violent than Somalia,567,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
I said one,315,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
"I know Yemen and Somalia are both dangerous places, but I have no idea which country is more  dangerous.",190,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
current active civil war in somalia,567,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
742,1177,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
i think Yemen is more violent also. i chose 1050,525,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
I think they are both pretty dangerous places,1841,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
"Okay, so less than 1000.",589,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
100,1504,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
I think Yemen is less violent,1303,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
I just know of the constant civil wars there.,1122,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
i day 700,690,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
Between 500-1000,589,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
I guessed 900,190,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
but Im not sure which is more violent to civillians,1841,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
How about splitting diff. 750,589,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
say**,690,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
I think they are both violent as well,177,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
500,381,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
i didn't know yemen was more violent i guess,1546,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
works for me - 750,690,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2
Good,1303,WPwSKngzvXCHfz5bS2

i did 690*2,1879,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
i said 15,718,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
50,1799,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
so what is it,1999,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
200 million,1999,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
we all have to come up with a decision,1879,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
I guessed way too high lol,565,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
im going to guess 1/6th,109,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
lol,1957,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
125 million,1999,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
25 milliom is my guess,1741,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
200mil ppl in US,1431,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
yea i guessed way too high i think,1879,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
i like 130 million,1719,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
"They didn't give us enough information - is this worldwide?  If so, it should be a pretty small percentage of 690.",1533,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
yes but it is not how many people in the US,1879,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
it is how many times a plane was boarded,1879,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
right its passengers  i think magpie is right . worldwide,109,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
that's just to help y'all guess,1431,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
ik,1431,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
even if the population of US is only 400mill,1879,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
if 200 mill in US can't be more than 20 mill,718,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
Idk those airports are really busy,1529,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
there are can be more boarding that the population,1879,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
right... and a round trip counts as 2,739,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
let's go with 200cmillion,1741,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
You can take multiple flights per year,595,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
saying if someone takes 10 trips a year,1879,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
yes exactly,1879,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
Yes,919,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
200 million sounds all right to me,1529,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
200 million sounds good?,1719,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
round trip = 2 passengers boarding,565,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
I'm okay with 200,1957,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
i mean those are high volume areas,255,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
Okay with 200,919,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
Im okay with 200 as well,790,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
1,1999,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
"200 feels high to me, but if we need to reach a consensus I think it's fine.",1533,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
very very busy airports,1719,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
it feels high to me,718,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
wow that is way less than i even guessed,1879,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1
200 mill seeems small,1879,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx1

howdy,934,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
All three airports are really high traffic,785,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
Can I change my answer?,216,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
what did you guys give for the answer,941,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
What did you all guess,1000,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
75 milly,934,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
Hi,646,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
i guesses 500 million,103,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
I put 15 million,970,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
I sad 260 mil,455,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
i guessed 200,941,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
43 mil,596,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
I meant to put in 34 million,936,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
330mil,1974,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
very high traffic locations,103,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
also 75,1129,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
2,304,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
25 mil,1000,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
I went 85 mil but i think thats way under,712,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
90,1640,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
I said 30 <U+0001F602>,785,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
not really to be honest lol,455,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
400 million :\,1506,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
we have less than 2 minutes to submit an answer,103,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
no data for me,1000,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
"I've flown out of JFK many times, it is always packed",1382,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
i mean theres no way 10% of all flight traffic goes through one airport..,934,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
"I think 85 mil would maybe cover la guardia and newark, maybe add like 150 mil for JFK?",712,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
"No, purely a guess for me",1974,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
i've been to jfk and there's always a lot of people there lol security takes forever,941,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
Most NYC are airports are packed,455,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
never been to jfk,596,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
La Guardia is pretty nuts too,455,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
i agree,103,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
"they're all high traffic, but not the most trafficked in the country",1129,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
690 million is world wide,1000,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
JFK is crazy though,455,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
but are we talking world wide or just USA?,1640,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
"I agree with gfk, it may be alot but 10% is insane",970,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
i think world,934,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
NY isn't a central hub with a ton of layovers,1469,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
laguardia is insanely crowded,941,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
Just guessing,1271,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
"HK has the busiest airport I think overall, I heard lately on the news",712,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
"I would think they are the busiest airports, however in the world?",216,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
I'd assume the definite range is 100-150 mil,455,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
what is our final guess,103,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
i would guess less than 10 percent,1000,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
it's likely lower than ATL and dallas as well as some others,1469,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
maybe 75-100,941,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
I think around 40-50 million,970,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
7% would be like 48 mil,712,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
i would say under 30 m,1000,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
its probably less if its worldwide then,455,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
I'm going less now actually,455,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
probaly 20 mil,455,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
26 mil go out of jfk,785,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
Big cities 10 million,646,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
24 mil,596,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
how do you know 26 mil go out of jfk?,1129,WrvqLbgk9YXoYgrtx2
Hi anyone here,1218,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
so what were yalls guesses. mine was 1200,1932,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
Hello,1108,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
Hi,1475,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
I think the answer is higher,1892,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
641,1292,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
hi,1707,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
Hi,16,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1

1000 or so,1019,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
Hi,575,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
1400,1218,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
I have no clue what this answer is,1678,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
I said 1000,1438,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
probs more,1019,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
I also think higher. I said 2000.,1475,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
it's probaby a few thousand,990,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
Hello everyone i guessed 2500,1892,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
I said 450,1678,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
I guess 1500,522,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
Its worse there,1131,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
2000,16,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
i guessed 1500,1707,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
I think it is more,575,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
1160,1563,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
Syria is a big group of war criminals,1892,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
I am leaning towards higher now that others say so,1108,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
somalia is big war time so is syria maybe they close?,1019,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
i wouldn't be suprised if it's higher,1892,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
I know I guessed to low. I wouldn't be shocked if it were 5 thousand even.,990,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
3000 maybe,1131,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
So likely double or triple then?,687,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
i don't think they're criminals,1292,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
too*,990,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
I will guess higher now also,1678,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
Id say at least double.,1475,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
no,1292,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
I think much higher,16,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
triple?,1019,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
no,1292,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
Hmm how high do y'all think it could be?,1108,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
lol the saudi government is commiting a genocide in yemen. if it counted those it would be 85000,1892,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
very criminal lol,1892,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
Wow,1108,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
3000,1903,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
I'm gonna go to 5-6000 now.,990,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
3500,1019,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
lol,1292,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
lol,1292,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
lol,1292,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
lol,1292,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
So maybe 1500,1678,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
"The point is ""intentional""",16,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
"Yes, I say 5000 ish",1108,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
"wait, not number of civilians either, number of events",990,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
if it's double,1678,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
that changes things,990,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
Oh ok,1108,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
yeah,1292,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
just events so mayb jsut double,1019,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
you dummies,1292,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
Im sticking with double. Im going with 2000.,1475,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
"""idoits"" lol",1932,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
just jokin,1292,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
Hehee,1108,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
yeah I'd guess 1200-1500,990,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
ghost.report,1932,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
gluck peeps,1019,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
NA,1139,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ1
Hello,207,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
Does anybody have any idea about this?,31,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
"This is tricky, do you think it is higher?",131,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
Hello,1864,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
what was your guess?,1296,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
Hi!,1082,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
Hello!,1348,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
Hello,736,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I guessed 1500,1864,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
higher,483,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
Hello I think higher,884,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I guessed 1500 too,1348,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
Hi,41,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I would assume higher but do you think all are recorded?,131,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
hello,1035,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
Id say higher,292,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
Hello.,227,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
500,736,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
i think higher,1035,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
"Hello, the number is DEFINITELY higher than Somalia, I gussed over 3000",1100,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
"In 2018, they recorded 841 such events in Somalia.",343,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I definitely think higher than 841,1348,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I guessed 600,1005,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
"I have no idea, but I guessed 2500. Has to be higher than Somalia right?",1082,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
No idea honestly. I guess lower,207,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I said lower,41,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I guessed 1200,884,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I'm looking it up now,1188,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
"In 2018, they recorded 841 such events in Somalia.",343,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
"Wild guess, 2000...wasn't that when they were bombing hospitals?",1536,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I'd think it would be lower,736,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
1200 as well,483,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I guessed 700.,227,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I went for 900,1296,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I said 890 because I wondered how many are recorded but I am not sure.,131,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
"In 2018, they recorded 841 such events in Somalia.",343,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I just thought higher due to all the crap going on over there,1864,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
over 1000,1035,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I think it's probably a similar number or slightly higher,31,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
"I think by and large civilians have been targeted for the majority of this conflict. I mean, Aleppo is straight up gone",1100,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
"Yea, there's a lot going on there, that's why I think higher",1348,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
Quite a lot going in Somalia as well,207,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I've not heard very much about syria. only just recently,736,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
It literally says the answer,343,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
"In 2018, they recorded 841 such events in Somalia.",343,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
We're talking about SYRIA,1100,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
not SOMALIA,1100,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I would think similar,131,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
Somalia is in Africa.. LOL,1348,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
Not sure where the answer would be close to but I guessed about 500 not knowing how many get recorded,41,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I would think similar also.,227,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
roughy 2000 civilians per month,1188,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I think Syria probably has more people impacted but less events,31,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
2000/mo = 12000,1100,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
per month? oh man,1082,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
err 24000,1100,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
oh god i need more coffee,1100,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
same,1082,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
"It's events, not civilians",31,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
yup,483,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
Somalia has been more active than syria until just recently,736,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
"pjay what does it say, we have 10 seconds",1348,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
Yeah not easy,207,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
500,736,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
NA,160,wwbgNJuXpTwsqxsZJ2
I have no idea!,1237,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I think it sold for .25 million,1040,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I said $4 million,5,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I said 3.5 million.,1562,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
i put 8m,134,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
18,1237,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I think it was definitely less than a million,1461,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
More than 10  million???,956,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I just don't understand how art can cost so much. I think 1.25 mil.,1429,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I'm thinking 20 million,1294,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I said 3 million,1650,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I said 8 but was probably too high,40,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I said 3.5 but idk,1347,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
5,1800,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
"less, it isn't one of his more famous ones",1040,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
"I said 2.0 million, but just guessing.",233,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I would go with 4 or less,40,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
No one over 10 mil???,956,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I said 8 but have no idea,1726,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I put in 4 million as a complete guess. I know van goghs are expensive..just dont know how much,372,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
lol,134,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I think the size of it may have made it more expensive,1562,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
7,1538,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
cause he's famous but it is not a very intricate painting,1650,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
somewhat of a sketch,1650,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
Its a drawing though. Not a painting could make it less,1347,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
yeah size is a factor as well as who he is,1800,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
It's nice. I'd hang it in my home.,1562,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
but still Van Gogh,1650,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
"art is funny, there is no reasoning to price",40,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
drawing seems more to me,1800,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
It is true that is big so it may garner more money,372,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
there are tons of picasso paintins and dali paintings most of them are not worth millions,1040,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
"I know nothing about Van Gogh or any art. So, I'm clueless.",1429,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
It is not a very well known image and I think his paintings are more valuable than a charcoal,1461,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
The age of the painting and the fact that he is an historical figure makes me think at least 20 million,1294,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
same here,134,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
i think because this isn't a more famous one it is worth less than a million,1040,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
"I think I might stay at $4 million, but I still have no idea",5,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
Think about how long it probably took him to sketch this compared to how much it probably sold for. Crazy.,1562,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
"Now Im thinking 250,000",1347,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
total guess,134,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I think the fact that it is less famous than others makes it even more important...maybe an earlier work?,1294,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
"it is crazy. I'm no artist, but i know a lot goes into it",1800,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I will still say over 2,40,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I'm interested to find out what the price was,1562,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
less famous works means leass demand,1040,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
No on over 10 mil?,956,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
5m seems good?,134,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
5 i think too,1800,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
no way it was over 10 or 5,1040,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I think if it was a painting and not much of a drawing that its not super high. Im not into art at all so im clueless,372,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
7,1538,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
"Not necessarily, less famous means hidden treasure!!",1294,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
Well I want to know now,1347,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I'm gonna stick with a low ball number. Maybe 2 mil.,1429,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1
I would still go less than a million,1461,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1

Hi,826,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I guessed 2.5,1356,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
hello,1671,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
Hi,1930,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I don't know anything about art,937,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
Hi,1936,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
Hello,1230,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
Hi,1711,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
Hello,1618,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
Hello,1440,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I guessed 1.5,1230,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
Does anyone know art?,1514,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I guessed 2.5 million too,826,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I also guessed 2.5,1259,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I guessed .45 but that was probably low,1849,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
me neither,1220,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
Hi there I guessed 10.5,852,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
"i guessed 10, but really didn't have a good idea of a reasonable answer",1027,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
hi,1492,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I said 1.3,1440,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I have no idea about art values,1618,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
"hey, any experienced folks here?",548,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I would assume it would be in the millions,1671,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I don't know much about at either.,1930,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
10 is too high,1356,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
But I feel like I guessed way too low,1230,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
i know nothing about art so i guessed 20 million,353,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
3million but I don't know,1514,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
3,1936,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I put 10 but i don't know,1711,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
"i guessed 2 million, but no idea",1550,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
"10 is probably too high, maybe 1-2 mil?",1849,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
low single digits is about right for prestige art,1356,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I guessed 2 million,1671,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I guessed 4 but I have no clue,1618,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I said 3.5 but not sure if this is too high,937,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
When did he die?,1514,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
.1?,1220,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
A few of us agree on the 2.5 million. I don't know much about this stuff,826,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
^,1440,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
"I went to Amsterdam this summer, but did not go to the Van Gogh Museum.",1514,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I don't think 10 is too high at all,852,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I think 2.5 sounds pretty reasonable but I'm no expert,1230,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
paintings in double M range,548,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
Me either,826,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
not sure,1492,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
"It's not a painting, though",1356,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
exactly,548,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
like a painting,937,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
It's charcoal on paper. People pay more for color,1356,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
it's also not as big as some other pieces,1711,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
It has to be a .5 whatever number you guess cause they always sell with a .5. That's all i ever catch on the news,826,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
i think it might be closer to 3.5 million,1550,Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm2
I said 35000,664,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
I said 10000,1976,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
I say easily 30000 without question such a great idea,1282,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
"Hi,so what do you all think?",867,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
"I said 10,000",685,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
I said 40000 I think they exceeded their goal but not certain by how much,1417,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
I said 5000,1039,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
"Hi all! I thought it raised 38,000. It's a creative idea and I haven't heard of anything similar",1136,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
It's a fairly unique idea,1417,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
i said 12000....didn't sound like a big money maker to me,1888,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
I thught it was a good idea and said 70000,388,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
Yes higher but for sure they met the goal,1282,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
Tough to estimate. Does this app sound useful? I said 7000,827,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
"I said 15,000. But im a pessimist  :)",1284,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
It sounds like a lot of hassle to me,685,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
5000,1193,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
"I said 20,000. thought it'd be close but not quite",982,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
"I say 30,000  sounds like a great idea",1187,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
"People don’t like to pay for music, in general.",1039,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
now I'm confused,664,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
A unique idea doesnt mean itll generate the full crowdfunding amount,1976,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
I think they will far exceed their goal,388,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
It is actually pretty cool and would get a lot of support from venues as well,1282,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
I thought so too,664,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
"Interesting idea, but musicians are usually broke (I'm one).",1328,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
And you have to go to a specific location to listen to it on an app?!,685,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
I know many unique crowdfunding ideas that far surpassed what they asked for and they were concepts people might not find useful,1417,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
its like pokemon go without the pokemon,1976,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
The concept is good and it would encourage and promote a lot of side things,1282,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
will musicians travel to certain spots just to listen to a new song?,1888,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
What's its advantage?,827,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
It's unlikely that the app raised exactly 30000.  It probably fell shorted or surpassed its goal by a lot - typical of crowdsourcing.,672,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
I don't see how it could take so much money for this app to be made,1193,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
It gets people out of the house and doing things which seems fun,1417,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
Lazy and cheap people. Not sure if it would be a big money maker.,1039,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
I think it made it's goal,664,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
agreed. would be good for runners and walkers,1976,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
but not much else,1976,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
"Its definitely unique, like the idea of it being pokemon go with music",1187,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
"I say 35000, how about if Mick Jagger dropped at a location",1282,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
and people visiting different cities to check out local music from that area,1417,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
I say 17000,867,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
Why would people do this when they can just download new music onto their phone or iPod?,685,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
I'm going to say that it failed - reached only 10000.,672,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
That's a great idea though  reminds me a Pokemon go in a way,1193,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
"I agree it is unique. Just not sure it has the market,.",1039,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
I'm sticking with 35000,664,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
It would catch on and some big peeps would drop at locations,1282,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
if is the functioning word there,1976,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
because downloading new music to your iPod isn't really a whole experience,1417,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
it'll probably hit the goal....musicians are interesting sorts,1888,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
people like to take part in things,1417,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
"Most of us go to locations to hear music anyway, why would this be differnt.",388,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
I say 35k at least,1282,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
Some people like to listen to new and unheard music,1187,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
35000,1282,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
35000,1888,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1
im sticking at 10000,1976,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1

Hi,1028,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
Hello,1583,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
What an odd app!,1228,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
Hi,263,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
"Hi. I guessed about 20,000 pounds.",908,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
How much do you think,1233,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
"Hello, I went with 15000 pounds",1050,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
"Hi. I think they raised the entire 30,000",1697,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
"What did everyone guess? I went with 17,000",1153,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I guessed 40000,828,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I put 18000,1233,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
"i guessed 100,000",2017,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
Hi,102,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I'm still thinking,1439,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I figure crowd funding either good ideas always makes a could times more than what they ask for,1487,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
i guessed 105000,1023,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I said 20000,1583,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
75000,1487,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I thought the app was strange,1228,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
cause normally with bidding you would get close to your asking if you have proof of concept,1588,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
10500,1869,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I think 40000 as well. Equity in the company is attractive and music is magic,1028,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
a lot of investors could find use for it since they could promote stores and restaurants near the song drops,2017,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I FIgure the amount is small enough they met the goal,1204,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I also thought the app was strange,263,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
Yes with a just little over maybe,828,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
That was my thought - it isn't a huge amount,1697,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
"Yeah, that's a good point. They probably made what they were asking for at least",1153,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
"I thought maybe it would be hard to raise that much off top so i figured 20,00 was a good guess",908,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
"I think people would like it at first, but not use it more than once.",1233,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
45000,1869,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
Maybe I’ll go with 30000,1050,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
That’s not much for crowdfunding,1487,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
if this is a file sharing app,1228,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
"a lot of investors could find use for it since they could promote stores and restaurants near the song drops. i think 100,000",2017,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I think it will be toward to lower end,263,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
id say 18.5,1588,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
55000,1869,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
50000,178,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I still think 40000 or 45000 would be good,828,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
then I'm not sure why people would donate a lot to it,1228,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
20000 to be safe,1050,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
Good point hdawg,908,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
They may have gotten 20000 pounds.,1439,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I also think promoters will jump on this,1028,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I just dont see people raising money for unknown apps unless they are exciting,1583,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
45000,1869,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
They’d donate for benefits,1487,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
Good way for ppaces to advertise as well,908,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
crowfunding has perks you get first dibs on updated software and events,1588,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
Investors do get a part of the profits,828,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I think 45000 sounds pretty fair of a guess,1153,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
40000,1869,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
so what's the consensus?,1228,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
NA,628,XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic2
I think it’s more than double,333,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
Hi all,1565,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
What did you all think?,1239,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I went with 2000,1653,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
"I said 1250, but that was a complete guess",1565,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I thought about 500,1390,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I said 200 because there is an increased focus on Syria,1962,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I thought SOmalia was worse,440,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
i think syria is in more rough shape than somalia so i put it a little higher,519,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I said 600,2015,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I think it is a LOT more than double with all due respect,322,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I said 450,1239,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
atleast 950,2003,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I said 50000,322,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
Guessed 650,1676,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I thought less.,1495,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
"I did about 2,000",333,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I said less for syria,440,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I guess we'll find out soon,1239,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
i just put it conservatively more at ~1050,519,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
But Syria is just one of the countries,1390,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
"have to remember it's civilians intentionally targeted, I guess",1653,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
10 per day,15,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I guessed the same. 841.,314,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
Syria has been such a mess for years - and Assad is attacking his own citizens,322,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
"Yeah, it may be a play on words to try to cause a little confusion",1239,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
lol no he isnt,2003,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I figure they have mass attacks compared to individual,333,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
They don't say if it is people VS incidents,1962,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
"Syria has OIL, that's the only reason syria is in trouble",2003,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I still think Somalia is worse than Syria for this kind of thing,440,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I think the organization tracks data for many countries,1390,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
and Syria is just one of them,1390,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
notice ISIS disappeared after Trump took office?,2003,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
how is somalia now? I thought Syria's situation should be better,1495,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
The war in syria is intentionally targeting civilians.,322,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
"at the end of the day I don't really have any familiarity with either country, just going off the random stuff I hear to be completely honest",519,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
it's targeting oil.,2003,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
The whole point of this game is to work people up over politics lol,333,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
Targeted civilians... seems like the Syrian government would be more effective at targeting civilians than the Somolian one would,1565,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
random stuff could be fake,440,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
you could all be fake lol,1653,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
Russia is also targeting civilians,322,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
Hope it is not just about politics,1390,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
beep boop,2003,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
almost over,1495,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
I still think it is in the tens of thousands,322,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
Gimme da loot,333,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1
well give it our best guess,440,XZBk9dHDhHDSM5hFS1

hi,2014,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
Hello,583,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
i guess 20 mil,1570,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
"Hello, everyone",904,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I said 18m,1945,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
Yo.,1842,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
What does everyone think,487,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I guessed 70 million,487,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
200,1121,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
i said 40,1272,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
"are these the busiest airports in the world, when combined?",893,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I guessed 7 million,1709,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
because it's round trip,487,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I think 100 mil,464,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
45,462,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
i chose 200mil,904,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I said 300,71,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I went with 300 million because huge airports,350,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
42,2014,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I think my guess (7) is too low,1709,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
200 is a good #,1121,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
"Yeah, JFK is huge",464,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
went with 55 millions,1316,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
70 million was my guess but I'm probably too conservative with it,487,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
i said 100 mil,613,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
it said 690 million boarded planes i assume across the whole world?,1272,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
the u.s or the world?,904,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
maybe 50 mil,893,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I also said 300,1306,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
"I said 350 because those airports are super popular, probably a little too high though.",1836,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
whole world I think,893,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I think it's the whole world,350,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
350 seems to high; it's almost half the 690,1709,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
is it domestic or international?,1316,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I think both.,464,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
Yeah I went big.,1836,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
i think 18m but will go with what ever,1945,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
agree -I think they mean both,350,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
ok,1306,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
"there is not a lot of transfers through those airports, not like chicago or dallas",893,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I'll bump it down some.,1836,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
how can you be sure,1316,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
is 690 million for us or worldwide?,2014,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I will increase mine to 90 million,487,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I feel like a lot of people would go in and out through NY internationally,350,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I'll go with 80-100 million,1709,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
This would be really hard to guess without more information.,583,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
you're right,904,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
100-200 so 150,1121,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
25-50 million,893,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
175?,904,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
165,1306,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
we are!,350,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
100,1945,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
We are lol,487,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
100 million it is,487,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
165,904,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
everyone guess 100,1945,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
95 is my final guess,1709,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
I am sure my guess was wrong.,583,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71
"Sure, 100",1842,Y3kGc7g48FzHnkyy71

4000,1989,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1

i said 9500 think i should go lower,324,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1

I think 4000. Seems right to me,390,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
"I went with 795. I thought that overall the cost of running the school, recruiting, repairs to the building and all other things must be high.",169,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
its over 9000,311,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
Think about all the salaries etc,1288,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
I think it's in the lower range.,1511,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
"I said 800, but I was thinking per credit hour",93,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
"Yeah but some schools have 10,000 students",169,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
its all way too much no matter how you look at it,1995,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
I guessed 4500. Total guess.,1834,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
I think 4000,1989,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
at least 5000,1995,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
yeah me too think it is lower than 9500,324,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
I think it's higher than the tuition amount.,1068,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
I think I may have been low but I feel anything over 2000 is too high.,169,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
"Instruction per student, cost of instructor, cost of classroom",1511,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
"It’s expensive, but 4000 seems spot on",390,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
How?,1989,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
i think so,1995,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
youre right,1995,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
for sure,1995,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
"It's per student per year, right? Not per class.",1068,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
It said per student,169,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
at least fifty million,1995,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
Yes,1989,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
i think somewhere between 4000-5000,324,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1

4000 is fine with me,93,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
Me too,537,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
oh yeah,1995,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1
between 2-3500,1288,YY8WgjCmFtEFoHNRh1

Just being honest here.,845,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I just put about the same...,831,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I guessed 850,619,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
me either lol,889,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I kind of feel that Baltimore Is more violent,649,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
Me either,1722,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
i put 1000,889,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I said 2000 but its probaly alot more,39,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I think its about 500 more,991,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I have no clue. I’m just guessing.,1443,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
"I put around 1,800.",845,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I put 900,649,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I put 5000 because i thought chicago had the highest gun violence,983,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I would not be surprised if it was somewhere in the 5000's considering Chicago gun violence.,398,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
1000,1433,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I'm going to assume they're not too far apart.,845,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
"Me neither. Chicago is pretty bad, I put 1500",257,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I put Chicago higher due to size of the city,229,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
i probably went way to high,983,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I have read recently that gun rates are falling,415,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I think Baltimore is the most violent so I would think Chicago would not be as much,831,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I put 2500,1722,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
"Nope, that's fair. I said 5000 as a high estimate though, I think they are way highter than baltimore",338,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
"I guessed 1200. Chicago is way bigger than Baltimore, but Baltimore has the highest per capita violent crime.",1754,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
chicago is very violent; i said 5000,444,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
"I guessed 2400, its got to be much more than Baltimore",552,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
Chicago is a horrible anti gun place where only gangs have the guns and the power,39,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
"Melly: most violent per capita, but chicago is a lot bigger.",1754,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
chicago has a lot of violence too. i would think they would be about the same,889,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
"Yeah, I know Baltimore has a lot of crime, but is Chicago a lot bigger?",831,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I put 600,415,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
"Should we go somewhere in the middle, like 2200?",845,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
more gun laws = more violence,39,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
i definitely think we should go higher than the 1113,889,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I put 1515,991,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
Anyone know how much bigger Chicago actually is,831,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
sure but its probably alot higher,39,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I really don't know if that's true.,845,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
Bigger cities are prone to more violence.,1443,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
My guess was totally lower than everyone else's,415,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
"yea, chicago is notorious for gun violence",338,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I put 4800,229,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
i may say 3000,444,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
frantically googling,619,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
its really hard to guess though,889,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
Less regulation because harder to manage.,1443,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I'm going with 2400.,845,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
i was googling too! lol,889,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
i am pretty certain it is higher than 1130,983,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
"Melly: good question, but it is the 3rd or 4th largest urban area in the country. After NYC and LA",1754,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
im going around 3000 too i think,983,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
What does google day,1722,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
ill go with 3000 i guess,39,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
amasimp: are we allowedto google?,1754,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I put 1000 but now wondering if it's too low... I felt like it would be about the same but if Chicago is that much bigger than might be higher,831,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I just read 542 murders in 2018,415,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
3rd largest after LA,229,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
thats just murders,39,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
But that doesnt account for all violence,415,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
not all shots = a kill,39,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
maybe 10 times the murders,444,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
wow... and way more guns violence,831,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
yes,889,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
"so yeah, I'll be going up",831,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
i think chicago has higher gang activity too,983,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
i think close to 2000,889,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
me too i think,619,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
Over 5000 I think,229,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I wonder what the murder comparison for Baltimore is,649,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
"Murders dont mean gun violence, brandishing a firearm is gun violence",552,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I'm upping to 1500,1754,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
NA,1693,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa1
I would think more than baltimore since chicago is the most violence city,366,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Is 150 high or low you think?,1369,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
What were the other answers?,1594,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
i think more than double baltimore,880,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"I guessed 10,000.  Chicago is a mess",105,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I think 150 is very low,2025,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I put 2000.,1594,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Hi I agree,1847,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I guessed 3000,59,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I guessed 5000.,90,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
probably 1200,839,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Chicago is a lot larger than Baltimore too.,1525,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
If I'm not mistaken Chicago has a similar or much higher crime rate than Baltimore,506,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I ageee Rocky,132,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Baltimore has WAY more violent crime than Chicago,751,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I put 3k,506,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I said 980,751,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
2000,1847,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
i said 3000,880,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Baltimore is def worse because I used to live there,1369,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
maybe 150 per month,839,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Not sure by how much.,1525,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Chicago is known for violence and is larger than Baltimore.,1359,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I guessed 3000,1718,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
i guessed 2k,242,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"I figured more than Baltimore, but I didn't know how much more.",1594,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
2500 here,1525,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Chicago would have more crime I believe.,90,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Definitely higher for Chicago,1406,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
probably over 2000,1184,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Racergold do you know how much bigger Chicago is?,1594,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
3000 wouldn't surprise me though.,1525,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I guessed 1300+. How much bigger is Chicago?,1359,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
it's over 1200 shot in 2019 so far,839,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
chicago is in the new all the time tho for gun violence,880,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"The average homocide rate in Chicago is lower than Memphis, TN.",751,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"I chose 1200, I it is very violent, and it is larger than Baltimore, I think around 2500.",2025,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Chicago is much bigger than Baltimore,506,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"so for 2018, going by that trending, maybe close to 2500 or higher",839,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
TRUE,1847,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I'd assume over 3000 for Chicago.,90,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I lived in milwaukee and I remember hearing a figure about chicago having around 10 shootings a day...which is in the 3-4k range,59,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
2500,1898,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
The stats about the homocide rate in Chicago are blown vastly out of proportion by many media outlets,751,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Interesting,1847,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"I am going to go with less than a 1,000",1369,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"Yeah, I feel like my answer of 2000 is too low now.I would guess 3k-4k maybe",1594,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
The gun violence rate is the same.,751,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"Guessing an ""event"" is anything regarding guns at all",105,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"keep in mind this is about shootings, not just homicides",839,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
definitely over 1000,366,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Less than 1000?!,1525,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
5000?,1847,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"like if a person sees a gun, an event is logged",105,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I am thinking an event is gun deaths,1369,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I guessed 35,1406,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"Yeah, 1 person shooting 10 people is considered ""an event""",751,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"It's not homicide rate though, it's gun violence acts",1594,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"it just says gun violence, not homicides",839,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Sooo zero??,1847,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Yes it could mean a number of gun incidents.,90,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"Then I am going to say around 2,000",1369,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"You'd have to consider the crime rate and accidents also, since they log all gun violence",506,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
suicides  count as gun violence,839,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"No, not zero",1594,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
5000?,59,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I still say just under 1000,751,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
"any event, not just deaths",366,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Lol kidding 2000,1847,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
Not sure difference in population?,1359,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I wish I knew the sizes of Baltimore and Chicago,1594,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2
I assume Chicago is more dangerous then Baltimore,1010,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
hey,1567,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
i said 1300 because chicago is a bigger city,74,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
yes it is,622,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
Chicago has the highest rate of gun violence in the US.,1421,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
I guess so,1699,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
Yea,1699,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
Chicago obviously should be a higher number.,1765,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
but baltimore is pretty violent?,74,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
Anyone have a good guess? I know it's higher,1691,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
chicago gun rate is actually less,1567,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
I remember hearing this in the news,1421,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
"yes, I agree I say 1500",317,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
yes,234,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
I was thinking the same thing,1968,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
Its Chicago so its high,727,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
so...i thought this would be computation....but i also guessed chicago beats out baltimore,1826,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
i said only 500,1020,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
i wouldn't be surprised if chicagos is double that of baltimore,622,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
Chicago is definitely more,1735,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
Baltimore has very very high crime but I do think Chicago's is higher,347,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
I said like 1984,1421,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
Agreed,2033,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
I guessed 3000. Too much?,1765,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
I think Chicago has one of the worst crime rates in the US.,1428,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
I said 1200,1445,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
I tossed out 2500,1010,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
I say at least 2000,727,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
It has to be around 1500 if not some more,1968,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
I thought more like 2000,234,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
3000 is too much,74,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
I thought it was closer to 3000 too,1691,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
Thinking Chicago is higher,2033,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
I did 1850,347,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
"Chicago is filled with ghettos, so they all like to shoot themselves there",1421,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
i went hightoo 2000,452,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
Is 2000 a good middle ground?,1699,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
i agree that chicago is more dangerous i sould have guessed higher,1020,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
gun violence is really bad there i think its probably like 1950,622,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
Maybe 1850?,1691,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
i said 1453,1826,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
"57,339",1735,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
i think baltimore has a super high crime rate,74,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
2000 is safe,317,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
Put 10000 myself,2033,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
I would think around 2000 myself.,1428,Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3
